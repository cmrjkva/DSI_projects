    "\n",

    "### Centralized Workflow\n",
    "**How It Works**: The remote repo has one single branch on it, `master`. All collaborators have separate clones of this repo. They can each work independently on separate things. However, before they push, they need to run `git fetch`/`git pull` (with the `--rebase` flag) to make sure that their master branch isn't out of date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Branch Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**: This workflow is very similar to the 'Centralized' workflow. The biggest difference is that there are branches (which helps to keep feature-related commits isolated), and that instead of pushing changes up directly, collaborators:\n",

   "source": [
    "### 'Gitflow' Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**: Similar to the Feature Branch workflows, but with more rigidly-defined branches. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical Branches : `master` stores official releases, while `develop` serves as a living 'integration branch' that ties together all the standalone features.\n",
    "- Release Branches : 'release' branches might exist for any given release, to keep all of those materials together.\n",
    "- Feature Branches : pretty much the same as in the prior model.\n",
    "- Maintenance/'Hotfix' Branches : branches used to quickly patch issues with production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed Workflows\n",
    "These approaches all use multiple remote repos; typically, everyone has their own fork of the 'original' project (the version of the repo that's publicly visible and is managed by the project maintainer), and changes are submitted via pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Manager Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**: One collaborator plays the role of 'Integration Manager'. This means that they are responsible for managing the official repository and either accepting or rejecting pull requests as they come in.\n",

    "\n",
