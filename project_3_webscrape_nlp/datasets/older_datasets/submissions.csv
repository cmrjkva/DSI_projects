37,starwars,ive heard people defend it as nothing in a new hope outright said that mustafar was the last time obi-wan and vader encountered each other while theyre technically right people arent realizing what kind of floodgates these plots are opening for example a few years from now disney might release a book that reveals leia had an affair and that ben isnt actually hans son doesnt that sound dumb and flies in the face of the entire sequel trilogy well theres technically no contradiction since we never saw han and leia have sex see the point im trying to make the kenobi show is opening a dangerous floodgate when it comes to the franchises stories as much as i love hayden and ewan i dont want to support a show that could lead to further cracks in the fragile foundation of this franchise,the kenobi show and continuity

66,starwars,,i did a color pencil drawing of *that character* from chapter 5 of the mandalorian i though you guys would appreciate it
67,starwars,just a fun discussion to create your own character thats either standalone or ties into existing star wars stories:i’ll go first:fletcher tannon a mandalorian was born 22 bby as a mandalorian not long after his birth death watch attacked their clan’s town and bo-katan killed his father it was related to his father’s mandalorian creed but he never discussed it he joined the empire late around the age of 23 he rose through the ranks at the academy quickly and was sent to scarrif to become a death trooper death trooper dt-271 or fletcher tannon finished his training with his squadron and entered his first mission protecting a commander at the battle of endor the battle seems to go well until it doesn’t his commander is killed the higher ranking officers are gone and the squadron is captured by the rebellion being their first assignment after the heavy training on scarrif they didn’t know anything useful but having little true loyalty to the empire they revealed everything they knew mostly info regarding death trooper training and some bits of info regarding the empire’s intentions after the battle of endor if they succeeded the rebellion still places them in custody for a shortened sentence of 3 years since they were imperial though not guilty of much else in prison the squadron’s hatred for the empire grew fletcher especially hating their treatment of mandalorians his people after being freed the squadron meets on naboo to figure out what they’re going to do fletcher decides to return home to his mother’s mandalorian clan one of the squadron decides to become a bounty hunter its what he does best and has no other allies or skills one joins the new republic and the last one joins fletcher to go to his home having no family himself when fletcher returns to his mother he learns how much the tannon clan has changed since he was a child they allied closely with moff gideon and his claim to mandalore and have changed their colors to gideon’s black and white though he accepts his father’s armor as it was unchanged and unworn since his death and not only that his clan won’t accept his longtime friend as a foundling he learns of bo’s return and the claim of din a foundling and his hatred for her burns as the clan rejects her claim since she didn’t accept it by combat and gideon won it by tradition though he is intrigued by din’s arrival as an unknown character to the clansbasically a character that shows bo’s past and the effect gideon had among the mandaloriansso create your own character what’s yours,create your own star wars character

88,starwars,i wont bore you with my love of this movie its my favorite i have my reasons you have your reasons why you might not like it but id love to talk about my writing partners ideas that wouldve improved the film and probably also decreased backlash 1 first and foremost dont make poe and holdo enemies; make them unwilling partners who both share a love of leia poe takes after leias rebellious side holdo takes after her strategic side in this version holdo is on board with the finn &amp; rose mission but has her doubts she and poe argue about retreat vs fighting back and how they can keep everyone together poe still learns his lesson that its not about being a hero and taking out bad guys its about saving lives 2 instead of fathier racing its the children being forced to pod-race get a little nostalgia in there it changes nothing from the story and a pod-racing chase scene wouldve been awesome they still get to destroy the casino by flying through it and destroy shady supplies in the process 3 extend lukes flashback dont have him immediately buried under rubble have him caught off guard enough where the attack on his temple is still a success but also show him being a badass that was expected of so many people he wields his green lightsaber he takes out a knight of ren or two spars with a fallen ben and finally forces them to retreat then he self-exiles in shame even as someone who loves this movie i can easily say that these three very minor changes/extensions wouldve improved the movie and pleased more star wars fans plus it keeps in tact all the things that i find amazing in this film,the last jedi is my favorite star wars film but my friend suggested three minor tweaks that even i think wouldve made the film better
89,starwars,,yes the duo

100,starwars,i also have a question about thrawn since alot of sw fans want him in but i only have limited knowledge of him what seperates him as a villian from vader palpatine/snoke and kylo i think he is just like a war general person like he has others do things for him so is he just a blue version of peter cushings character or is there more to him,spoilers a question about thrawn
101,starwars,how does general grevious have a cough if he is a robot,question
102,starwars,i havent seen all of clone wars or rebels yet which i believe the batch debuted on but what is the big deal with them that seperates them from regular stormtroopers i think they are genetically modified but im not sure so that would mean they are stronger and faster i guess but if so i assume they werent successful cause they dont make it to force awakens-rise of its just stormtroopers and red stormtroopers but none of them come off as super soldiers same goes for these dark troopers they never show up again,spoilers a question about bad batch

118,starwars,you got this simple farm boy from sand world he has two loving parents theyre not his mom and dad but they love him as a son then one day things get a little out of his hand with his new robot toys and when he gets home his parents the man and woman who raised him the folks that are bit hard on him but still understand him enough well theyre just vaporized arent they theyre not stabbed theyre not shot they are fucking skeletons and luke is just well it appears to suck a little for him; definitely gonna put a damper on his day its at least gonna make the next hour kinda shitty but then this old guy ben who hes known for all of about thirteen hours is struck down by another random stranger and luke just about loses his shit death to space nazis death to robot men with red laser swords death to anyone who insulted this old man who could do magic tricks its depression time his magician buddy is gone; shit he might not even actually be dead there wasnt a body and luke is pretty confident he heard him tell him to run away but he aint actually here with luke so he might as well let this hot girl who only lost her entire fucking planet comfort himskip ahead a bit and luke goes to avenge his surrogate grandpa who he knew in real life for less than a day and still may or may not be around its kinda unclear to luke as he was either hallucinating on the brink of an icy death or had been chilling with a talking frog the past few days so it made sense anyways he confronts the murderous robot human who is also space hitler but also his daddy thats right space hitler killed lukes friend but now hes also ready to be a part of his life and have a real relationship provided a lil genocide is on the table every now and then luke says no but then mulls it over a bit and like maybe if he can convince his deadbeat dad to stop committing genocide and in fact fight against the genocide maybe they can do that game of catch every once in a while and enjoy the benefits of traditional family values tl;dr: luke doesnt give a fuck about the people who raised him as their own from birth but a few hours is all he needs to grow permanently attached to a religious hermit and literally space hitler who killed the religious hermitobviously this post is tongue and cheek im just saying that star wars has always been inconsistent and silly with its characters and thats okay we can still love it and appreciate what we got rather than hating what we didnt,lets talk about luke skywalker for a second because this guy is wild

126,starwars,id like to see a star wars game with metal gear solid rising revengance mechanics so you can have the option to just slice the enemies weapon or cut off a limb and send them on their way have minibosses where if you beat them and let them live you see them later having abandoned their faction or they come back to settle the score could set it in a post order 66 world and take some inspiration from the last of us 1 by making your character a younger jedi knight who just started training their first padawan before everything fell apart might even work in a bit of a narative of certain choices like putting survival above all else and abandoning your morals makes you slip to the dark side just an idea my bored mind thought up but im really liking the concept,idea for a star wars game
127,starwars,,credit to u/obi—wankenobi for the vader image
128,starwars,,a star wars comic i drew a few years ago
129,starwars,in the mandalorian we get to see the legend himself: luke skywalker he is a fully realized jedi and he is now the most famous man in the galaxy luke is now spending his days traveling the galaxy looking for force sensitive beings to induct into the new jedi order this is his chance to save the jedi once and for all and this is where everything falls apart in tlj we learn that luke sensed the dark side in ben and acted on impulse trying to kill ben so that he couldnt destroy what luke had worked to build with his blood sweat and tears at first like a majority of others i couldnt believe my eyes luke skywalker would never do that how could luke do such a thing this isnt lukeand then i saw luke in the mandalorian and all the puzzle pieces came together picture this: youre luke skywalker you have defeated your father and the empire is practically no more *all eyes* in the galaxy are now on you you are the legendary luke skywalker you are the paragon of good you can do no wrong and you accept this you allow the legend to permeate and spread because what are you going to tell these people not to look up to you you who in their eyes single handedly took down the two most feared men in the galaxy so instead you allow this to happen while devoting yourself to rebuilding the jedi order remember at this time you believe that you are the **only** chance the jedi have left so you do what is expected of you you go around the galaxy you recruit students and you do your best to teach them the ways of the jedi of old after a decade perhaps more of doing this it happens you sense something something you havent felt in what feels like a millennia you brush it off thinking that one of your students is frustrated or having a bad day then it comes back and then again and again you keep getting these pangs of dark and you know where theyre coming from but its ben han and leias child its ridiculous to think that he would ever harbor such negative emotion hes probably just prone to impulses like his father but as the months drag on you cannot ignore the growing darkness in his heart youve tried to advice him to remind him of the jedi ways and he scoffs he wont listen one day youre patrolling the grounds and you feel it the dark side you havent felt it so intensely since since vader and the emperor you the legendary luke skywalker heir to the jedi now has a tangible threat to your jedi order years spent trying to foster a new jedi order and one of your students can spell the end of it all doubt creeps in how could i let this happen im luke after doubt comes fear if ben turns on us on my students everything will be lost i will have failed the jedi failed the new republic the jedi as the galaxy knows it will be destroyed foreverfear is the path to the dark side fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering so you do it you resolve to destroy the roots before they can spread you enter bens room lightsaber in hand you ignite it you are going to save the jedi your own morality no longer matters it is the good of the galaxy and the fate of the jedi for the life of one man then ben looks at you fear in his eyes you realize that youve gotten it all wrong you have failed it is you that has driven ben to the dark side ben collapses the room before you can protest and runs away never to return it was you it was the legendary luke skywalker that destroyed the jedi order as you can see i believe that it was the legend of luke skywalker and the pressure put upon him by the entire galaxy that drew the dark side to manifest itself in him again as it had when he fought vader the dark side was always there in him it didnt disappear forever when he forgave his father it bided its time and prayed upon his fears and doubts as his legend grew larger and in that one fateful moment he fell from grace and the rest is history i hope that this gets expounded upon more in the future because i think it reminds us all that luke is still just a person he has flaws and he can make mistakes in the heat of the moment luke is not the unfillable legend that we all believed him to be that is why i think luke in tlj works so well and why the mandalorian only reinforces that now im not a fool obviously 99% of yall are gonna disagree and drag me through the mud but it wouldnt be the first time i just hope that you can look at luke in a new perspective even if you still vehemently disagree with me after all it is multifaceted and complex characters that make star wars so much more interesting than many other properties out there i would love to hear your own takes on luke and where he will end up thank you for reading tldr: the legendary luke skywalker realized in the mandalorian does not retcon tlj luke but reinforces it the pressure of the galaxy on his shoulders is what allowed the dark side to manifest itself within him despite avoiding it for decades,the mandalorian has made me appreciate tlj more than i thought i would

212,starwars,,pov: youre sand
213,starwars,like come on these are just dumb adventure movies designed to sell toys and always have been they literally invented wide spread merchandise for films so why are we treating them like religious texts or high art that can be tainted by the evil corporation no its always been a cash grab its a movie there is no artistic integrity when you are selling action figures and lunch boxes now am i degrading the hard work of the people who makes these movies no never they work thier asses of and make very fun movies i would love to make one myself one day but lets remember who the target audiences for these movies are 8-12 year olds kids not the 50 to 40 year olds who watched them in the 80sperhaps this is just the struggle of a franchise that crosses so many generational lines,star wars is dumb
214,starwars,so as the title says im looking for a star wars themed chess set which is more on the high quality side not like the cheap plastic hasbro one the only one i found that looked really good was this one which is apparently limited to 300 sets which makes them very pricey  around 500€ if any of you know anything that fits my request it would be really apreciated if you could hit me up &lt;3,star wars themed chess set

218,starwars,while looking at the u-wing i noticed some similarities in its design as the cockpit/main body looks a lot like the y-wing’s especially when the wings are folded out while the engine section looks a lot like the x-wing’s with how it has two stacked on each side i was just wondering if the u-wing was supposed to be made from the parts of those two star ships or not,is the u-wing a combination of the x-wing and y-wing
219,starwars,i have come to a bit of a theory that yoga could be the father of grogu there is a lot of evidence to prove this we know that grogu was born in 41 bby the same year as anakin skywalker he was brought up at the jedi temple on coruscant which is where the jedi council was based at this exact time yoda and yaddle were both on the council and so could be his parents what do you guys think,is yoda grogus father

234,starwars,* *couldnt care less if luke is grumpy or he dies the sequel triology has some fun and entertaining scenes too i think** *peequels arent fantastic films very average but they dont ruin the franchise they werent trying to change the cannon which when you change basic rules set in a fantasy universe you are pretty much saying the writers dont know what to do*tldr : its the blatant laziness cashgrab that i hatei know fans think that the sequel triology will soon be regarded good in star wars fans eyes just like the prequels i dont see that happening why#1 lazy writingforce awaken everyone force sensitive everyone super lucky random kid levitate rake rey super powerful luke super grumpy liea actually trained to be a jedi so she can stay alive after the blast on the ship this is what the new sequel triology is to me this hurts the franchise throwing absolute dogshit around doing whatever the story wants the charachters to do they give whole explanation of liea being more or less a jedi in 5 seconds *ahem* george was apparently going to put leia incharge in his new triology the creator of the whole franchise wanted something else that made more sense then what disney chose *ahem* just for a 3 minute subversion scene this is the trainwreck the new movies areforce is such a vague device used in all the movies never explained *ahem* which george was apparently going to in his new triology *ahem* its more like force is used whenever the writer doesnt know what to do nowim a new fan they never explain what the force is so from what i understand from the lore present they still never explained all of this is any of the movies yet:force isnt meant to be sentient is it its more or less like gravity a thing that exists everywhere around us the only thing is beings with midi-chlorians can manipulate it so why is it awakewhy didnt it awake before it created anakin the chosen one yes but in the new triology everyone somehow is super lucky because of the force a random child can levitate a rake and call it towards him nowif it did awake why is it helping the jedis because as far as i know both the sith and jedi use the force dark force and good force arent two entities fighting so why is it trying to create balance in the first place who are the skywalkers why are they so powerfulwhat happened to palpatines son/daughter who even married them why did they and what happened after a daughter was given birth to why can palpatine only care for granddaughter and not his real daughter/sonthere were always only jedis no siths the force when used with anger and selflessness can give someone the power of the dark side so why did siths originated in the first place the only sense i can make of it is a jedi wanted something only the dark force can achieve so he turned evil to gain the powers and help himself why is it never explainedwhy is vader a moron all he cared for once was power and being a jedi master and learning more then he turns dark and doesnt learn the sexy brain transfer trick palpatine used to stay alive in rise of skywalker  why didnt the sith before palpatine use itso much is left unexplained and what they chose to do is prequels which fair play george wanted to do them for fun he had no plans of ever making star wars seriously after the ot they didnt ruin the logic they just were badly made films that are liked now because they are a meme they are hilarious and give atleast some insight they are passionate but not lazy 2 clickbaitrey is actually a sith robotwhat if kathleen comes out and announces this tomorrow just think this for a moment yeahthis is what most star wars fans felt while watching the last jedi the problem isnt what luke does its just absolutely dogshit clickbait clickbait isnt subversionwhy do you think they didnt make other movies or shows before making a skywalker triology and then said these new movies are not for people who are nostalgicany way you approach it these movies are cashgrabs after acquiring lucasfilms they didnt take a second to announce star wars and luke is back when you say that it logically means they are calling out the star wars fans who love the franchisethen you build up hype you release a 30 sec scene of a beloved hero a good scene but you do all this for hype then on last jedi poof what is the return here from the hype you generate its like if apple teases an revolutionary product and releases a 800$ plastic stand you will receive backlash for that,a explanation on why i who started watching star wars in 2020 still hates the sequel triology and why i think they wont be as liked as the prequels
235,starwars,,i made a model of the falcon’s kessel run damage

242,starwars,disclaimer: the goal of this thread is to laugh at some funny easter eggs or story stuff for the original will drop a prequel version its more for the community discussion so i wont do long post lets enjoy some of this i want to poke a bear so most of star wars has so many plot holes after watching the sequel i went back and watched the original and prequel trilogy i love this series and so invested we mando season ending perfect got me deeper into star wars but man if we take a way the cool universe dark and light symbolism saber fights lovable characters and one liners you see tons of plot holes its wild because the new trilogy is said to have many issues but i sat here and watched the prequel and original trilogy and both are super flawed story wise gonna ask you guys to drop some things that dont add up letting a ship get away because it had no life forms but they were looking for information leia she remembers her mom how her mama died at birthhow obi got so old between 19 years he ages like a clone obi forgot about leia when saying luke is our last hope but he was there for birthobi still wearing his robe but hiding he is a jediobi tells anakin he will be more powerful if he kills him still killed him but somehow anakin  learns how to be a force ghost luke learn to be a jedi quick which would be ok if others did the same but they didnt except maybe reyrandom thoughts hope you guys can add comedy to these,drop comments on things that dont add up in original trilogy movies comedy purposes

257,starwars,ok yall i have developed a spicy theory that will make sriracha seem like it is vanilla yogurt and here it is plo koon is alive and will return this theory comes from 3 bits of infofirst off we know that plo koon was killed in order 66 right wrong we know his ship was shot down but we never had a confirmation of his death the clones shooting at him were solders he had fought alongside of for 3 years in the clone wars plo also was a phenomenal pilot and the lego model of his space ship has an eject buttonsecond we know that plo koon was the jedi who brought ahsoka tano into the jedi order and was her mentor for years were he to make a cameo it would be huge for the upcoming seriesthird dave filoni is a huge fan of plo koon and he has stated in an interview that he does not believe plo is dead who is dave filoni you ask the director of the clone wars series and projected director of the ahsoka tano seriesfinally plo koon is one of the only cannon jedi who do not speak to rey in episode 9 of all the voice actors who make an appearance in episode 9 plo koons voice actor james taylor is not one of them i went back and listened 4 times to confirmto summarize this whole thing we know that plo is a member of the baran do order a force sensitive order of kel dor who survived order 66 due to their small size plo koon likely ejected from his ship fled to his home planet and has remained with the baran do order until his appearance in the ahsoka tano series in 2022what are your thoughts let me know below,plo koon is alive and will return soon and here is why

267,starwars,hey guys im hoping you can correct me in my thought process here  im watching cw for the first time a great show  but something keeps jumping out at me that all droid starships have artificial gravity and life support throughout the entire ship they also seem to be maned by battle droids instead of specialized droids designed for the specific tasks of flying a ship i understand that there are biological commanders that need life support on the ship but in a world where robots are your entire army would it not have been more efficient to design ships with a small section equipped with life support and the rest built to carry as many droids as posible,droid ships with full life support
268,starwars,let’s say the imperial forces proved to be too much for the rebels and the shield stays up luke is killed by palpatine and vader doesn’t redeem himselfhome one is destroyed by the death starhan and leia are captured by the empirethe super star destroyer is never destroyed,what if the empire won the battle of endor

291,starwars,,my favorite part of the mandalorians way of life
292,starwars,one thing i noticed very lightly during the first watch and more intensely on my second time through: \&gt;there is a huge difference in the body language/fighting technique between ahsoka and luke&lt; \&gt;ahsokas combat flows smoothly and shows more formalized training and an almost calm mindset which is imparted by the jedi order&lt;\&gt;lukes combat is more bastardized the movements while expert are very choppy and almost aggressive in comparison lending to his less formalized experiences as a jedi&lt;this level of detail even with something as simple as body language and mechanics shows the amount of love and care that goes into the series damn good job to peyton reed dave filoni and jon favreau damn good job,spoiler rewatching the mandolorian s2
293,starwars,so i’ve always just been assuming that during clone wars and the prequels that the separatists just wanted to rule the galaxy while the republic wanted everyone in the galaxy to be equal someone tell me what the republic and separatists actual goals were,soo what were the separatists goals during clone wars

322,starwars,force users abilty to fight extremely fast and deflect blaster fire allways had me wondering how they did it we know that force users can sense the future and the and near future seems more certain than distant future this got me thinkingcould it be that force users are sensing the future when they fight my idea is that the next two seconds are so firm in their minds that they are actually fighting two seconds into the future what we see as blinding speed is actually the force users just going through the motions of a move they allready finished in their minds waiting to be able to get to the next move they have allready seen through the force the same with blaster fire they know where the round will hit every time because they have seen them itso they simply but their sable in the waynow i have not read any of the eu so i dont know if there allready is a reson for this but for now it remains my headcanon,why force users fight the way they do

336,starwars,it is shown that force-sensitives always have significantly better then average physical abilities compared to the rest of their species but it seems that they arent consciously using the force to do this in most cases except yoda being a spinny frog in aotc so is it that they are just generally more robust or that they unconsciously use the force to empower themselves,about the enhanced physical abilities of force-sensitives
337,starwars,,force ghosts
338,starwars,as we all know the insectoid natives of geonosis are currently extinct except for maybe klik klak and the queen this doesnt really sit well for me because it genuinely upsets me that such a fascinating and architecturally brilliant species were so callously murdered by the empire as a thanks for building the death star given that the queen was last seen still alive and i belive its canon that geonosians can earn a way off the planet if they fight in the pentranaki arena plus kamino exists there is a chance for karina to be cloned and for the species to thrive but what do you think do you guys want the geonosians to come back i can personally see mando help klik klak out because they both know what its like to lose their families but hey thats just me,do you guys want the geonosians to come back

349,starwars,i am not a fan of rogue one: a star wars story id even go so far as to say its my least favourite disney era star wars film however i am clearly in the minority on this and everyone else on this reddit hails it as one of the best or the best film in the franchise ive seen lots of people defend it for a multiple reasons that i personally dont agree with but i was hoping some of you guys could shed some more light on your personal reasons for liking this film that im just not gettingfor arguments sake i do have a quick run-down of my likes and dislikes on the film i just wanted to outline the things that make it frustrating in my opinion to watch as well as acknowledge the good that is in it as it is not the worst movie if all time by any means:likes:- the cinematography is good like really good some real gorgeous shots throughout- the space battles are well-executed from a technical standpoint- i actually like cassian andor and would like to see more of him as he was really under-used imo looking forward to the disney+ series- the joke where the stormtroopers put a bag over chirruts head and he exclaims are you kidding me i am blind legitimately made me laugh out loud- it actually made the empire threatening- the cgi on tarkin and leia while not quite there yet is an impressive feat and looked better than i thought it woulddislikes:- the characters just the characters i had a hard time caring about any of them and i can usually forgive a dumb plot and other flaws if i like the characters enough     - saw gerrera - i have no idea what the point of his character is and it is not acted well we dont see any of his relationship with jyn as her adopted father and his death is meaningless if this character type is in your movie its kind of an unwritten rule that you should see a connection between them and their adoptive child     - jyn erso - i also dont care about jyn she has no particular skills likes or dislikes that made me relate to her lots of other characters had something to bring to the team sharpshooting hand-to-hand combat imperial knowledge etc but she just is related to someone whos actually important i also didnt buy her relationship with her dad of sudden belief in the rebellion in act 2 again if we had some time anywhere in the movie to see their relationship or her view of the world i might have cared but i just didnt shes also a super passive character basically being dragged along everywhere she went and told what to do until she decides she likes the rebellion which again made no sense to me     - bodhi rook - not a bad character per se but so much wasted potential and again we know nothing about him he defected from the empire but why then he gets his brain scrambled and then is fine 2 minutes later and then the movie kind of forgets hes even there this one is more frustrating because of how much people hate on finn for his wasted potential when bodhi has a pretty similar set up but is given even less insight into why he defected and everyone seems fine with it     - baze malbus - not much to say i just dont know much about him aside from he has a gun     - k-2so - i didnt find him funny and he was essentially just a one-liner machine for how much people rag on the comedy in the sequel trilogy im surprised he doesnt get more flack- the first two thirds of the movie are a bit of a mess i literally got whiplash from how many planets we went to in such a short amount of time and how many things were happening imo it was needlessly complicated for a plot that can be summed up with rebels steal the death star plans- i didnt care during the fight scenes even the darth vader hallway scene like it was well-executed filmed and choreographed well i just didnt get excited about it like a lot of people did- the whole idea that galen intentionally put that design flaw in the death star is kind of lame like if you were going to put in something like that to destroy the death star why make it so hard to hit and if its not supposed to be that hard to hit it kind of devalues the significance of lukes accomplishment- also did not buy the emotion in galens message to jyn just did not feel genuine to me we never get a single moment of the two of them together to connect with their relationship and as a result the whole thing rang hollow for meif you loved this movie i really want to hear why all the things i mentioned are my opinion and clearly im just not getting the same out of it as a lot of people are so im curious about hearing some real peoples thoughts please try to keep the conversation civil were all star wars fans here and i dont want to crap on anyones opinions,why does everyone love rogue one

355,starwars,not going to write an essay here but to sum it up the show was good enough to rekindle the flame i used to have for the star wars franchise i put it off for a long time because i was just a fanboy for jedis and seeing how it was mainly about gunslinging i wasnt too interested however while watching it i got hooked the quality of the series is just so high and resembles the old star wars vibes from the old movies from when i was a kid the recent movies were very lackluster and i basically stopped watching after the force awakens excited to see what happens next in the series and in the star wars universe in general,the mandalorian relit the flame i used to have for star wars
356,starwars,when you first introduced your kids to star wars what order did you show them the movies did you start with episode 1 or start with episode 4 like we grew up with,question for people with kids

375,starwars,the prequels used to be almost universally *hated* and now they are looked upon with fondness and nostalgia do you think we’ll see a similar dynamic as the sequels age,do you think people will start to like the sequels more with time like they did the prequels

381,starwars,,dumb question but was is obi-wan doing here
382,starwars,when anakin was young he got a blood test revealing his midichlorians the force more or less when anakin lost his limbs he would have lost a huge chunk of his midichlorians making him weaker but besides losing some of his midichlorians he was an unstoppable force with well the force but him losing his midichlorians and him seeming stronger does not really make sense,was darth vader’s force abilities weekened
383,starwars,plenty of good guys getting their own shows and movies i think we need more focus on the dark side i think something for vader or palpatine for sure is needed wish some of the legends stuff was canon so they could do darth krayt and his secret new sith order he was building,which sith character should get their own movie or tv series
384,starwars,,how would you have included anakin in the sequel trilogy
385,starwars,i got bored during the holiday period and decided to start watching clone warsi love everything star wars but i put this one off because i always thought this is just for kids etcjust finished the episode with &gt;99s death&lt; im so invested now never thought they could get me like that 😔now im hooked its amazing,clone wars - didnt expect feels
386,starwars,why couldn’t we ever get the generally grievous from legends or the 2003 clone wars series all of his 3d interpretations are just absolute pushovers what happens to all that skill and prowess they just made him one of those corny villains who twirls their moustache as they run away after the hundredth failed attempt i see no reason why he could have been as great as his 2d versions just why is there an actual reason,general grievous

396,starwars,this is my idea for a ki adi mundi biopic please let me know what you think and if you’d want to watch itfirst fifteen minutes quickly flashes through kis life and him having his many children and becoming a member of the jedi councilthen skips to his defeat on the battle of hypori and stages general grevious as the main villain ki adi mundi is crippled by defeat and turns to smoking spice which he becomes addicted to although he keeps his addicted hidden from the council his many baby mummies find out and revoke his rights to see his children mundi befriends an old pilot friend called olabar and they smoke spice together and talk about their pasts mundi and olabar agree to track down general grevious so they can be sound without the jedi councils knowledge they fly off to general grevious ship and boardafter a legendary lightsaber duel ki adi mundi is defeated just as general grevious is to cut off mundis head the ship turns sharply and a brick knocks mundi and grevious into an elevator shaft leaving their lightsabers behind mundi chucks around grevious with the force and remarks that he is “trapped down here with no freaking spice” grevious then opens up to mundi that he was also once addicted to spice and they have a deep chat about their addictions and how to overcome after two days in the shaft spending time with grevious causes mundi to discover his sith side count mundi uses his sith powers to lightning force the elevator shaft and spark it to work again grevious and mundi leave in peace and mundi returns i forgot to mention olabar died during the initial battlemundi goes back to the jedi council and get his life back together but has lost touch with his children the film ends during order 66 when mundi is shot down however annakin finds him and senses his sith side and heals his gun wound using jedi powerswhilst assumed dead mundi escapes in shipthe film will be followed by a dark comedy sit-com about mundi finding his children,ki adi munda biopic idea

428,starwars,ok so hear me out on this ive heard a lot of people kinda somewhat justify anakins actions of rebellion against the jedi because the jedi undermined all his skills and things he did for them however the jedi still only told him no so why couldnt anakin have splintered off and become some other form of jedi or why couldnt he just be like i dont wanna be a jedi anymore and still marry padame and stuff being told no doesnt mean you gotta go off and start murdering everyone btw just a funny take imo,all the jedi ever did was tell anakin no

435,starwars,first off i love pretty much all star wars media including series spinoffs and the sequels   generally it seems that revenge of the sith gains the top spot for most folks where a phantom menace and attack of the clones compete for the bottom spot: the deciding factor being how much one dislikes jar jar or sand   the reason i favor aotc for the top spot overall is in a sense twofold: its about what it does and about what the other two does not  phantom menace is actually a brilliant star wars film: it expands daringly upon the force it introduces mulitple fan-favorite characters and it sets the pace for the other two by setting up threads of political division and jedi failure there are plenty of real life sets and props and the music is fabulous it also introduces some of the coolest worlds the reason it doesnt quite do it for me is essentially scale: wheras the meta plot about the return of the sith and anakins induction to the order is fantastic the actual plot is about a trade dispute and blockade which means it cant quite match up to the start of the clone wars or its dramatic conclusion  revenge of the sith on the other hand should easily be the best but it lets me down in some core areas which means i never have quite so much fun i know that is controversial but some primary mistakes or shortcomings can be how it wasted padme as a character how the magnificent opening space battle is followed by what feels like a video game level how so much of the combat and action is centered around battledroids which are used as much for comic relief as for actual tensionbuilding and how three out of five lightsaber duels are in my opinion subpar or directly dissapointing dooku vs anakin and obi-wan is good enough obi-wan vs anakin is awesome but the remaining three just dont work the battle with grievous is so unengaging and given how climactic the duel between mace and sidious should have been it is a massive letdown the yodavsidious duel is fine but i think they missed a trick given how powerful they both are and we should have seen more large scale force battling   attack of the clones on the other hand is always super fun and rewarding for me to watch the only real drawback is some cringy scenes with anakin and padme which are excusable at best it begins with one of the best opening scenes in star wars with the naboo shuttle turning in space above coruscant and some awesome sound design from the engine it then goes into some fun setup with the assasination attempts and a logical starting point that being obi-wan and anakin sent to protect padme due to their familiarity we have some really cool exploration of the relationship between anakin and the jedi anakin and obi-wan and between anakin and palpatine it shows the best of what obi-wan and anakin has together but shows the shortcomings of obi-wan as a master to anakin as well we get jango fett as a badass villain with what in my opinion is a super interesting intrigue arch leading not only to the revelation of kamino as another cool world but the introduction of the clones all the while anakin and padmes relationship is furthered and some really good groundwork is laid for anakins eventual betrayal with the death of his mother the two storylines are tied together with each other and the meta-plot being the approaching war between the seperatists and the republic as a payoff we get the sublime arena scenes with some kickass jedi action in a time where droids are allowed to be more threatening and the superb entry of yoda and the clones the film kind of wraps up with my favorite confrontation of the prequels being the showdown with dooku  we get to see some awesome bladework from dooku and some interesting storytelling: obi-wan is smarter than anakin but anakin has more raw talent as a duelist both are relatively swiftly defeated and then we get a super tense and cool force duel between yoda and dooku finally showcasing yodas power this is also the first time we get to see tutaminis and i think they nailed the balance with regards to having dooku dueling yoda without it feeling too odd   overall i always enjoy aotc wheras rots and pm leaves me wanting or slightly dissapointed all are great star wars films but attack is my definite favorite,attack of the clones is by far my favorite prequel era film

455,starwars,all the new star wars content feels too forced for me other than rogue one which may be my favorite out of the entire franchise the writers seemed to shy away from original storylines and characters around every turn is a familiar face or place the charm i always thought was in the discovery of the world as you watch i really had a lot of problems with the mandalorian and the direction the tv shows seem to be taking the annoying part is i will probably watch everything they release because ive loved star wars for my entire life im not making a post to complain about it - i want to discuss because i cant separate those feelings from my enjoyment it seems like a lot of people are generally positive about the show but hated the recent trilogy to me they suffer from all the same problems the beauty of rogue one was completely ditching the known world the only real tie in is the single scene with darth vader and because it was just that one scene it was fucking awesome and memorable now we get a familiar face every episode or movie and i dont see that stopping anytime,do others feel that star wars has lost its charm
456,starwars,,made this song using samples from star wars also influenced by it as well let me know what you guys think

466,starwars,,this isn’t my best artwork but it’s something
467,starwars,i will explain my reasoning simply and relatively quicklyi understand maul lived through being cut in half and falling down a reactor shaft + sidious being alive in ep 9 but that doesn’t mean we have to bring back every dead force user i understand it could make for a compelling story thus why i enjoy swt vader fan film but i think it sort of takes away of what anakin did in rots if mace is alive yes he killed younglings and many more jedi that night but the idea of him being the reason mace is dead adds some real weight to what he has done“what have i done”so lmk what you guys think of this possibility and who knows maybe you’ll sway me the other way,mace windu potentially being alive is dumb

510,starwars,when luke dies he becomes one with the force but i just want to be certain did he just give up trying to live because if i understand correctly like was only 53 at that point so he wouldnt have died of old agedid he feel like his work was done and his life over,in the rise of skywalker

515,starwars,it bugged me for a while but i never found out the answer  at the end of the battle of yavin we see the millennium falcon two x-wings luke and wedge and one y-wing flying away from the death star  im not even sure how many ships originally launched from yavin iv but it appeared that all of the y-wings were shot down doing the trench run  were there back-up y-wings just in case some got shot down before they could make their run and one just hung out while the other three did the runi imagine that there was plenty of fighting that happened off screen  there were an awful lot of pilots in the briefing room compared to what we saw get blown up  i know in one of the books it talked about how there were more pilots than ships but why brief them all if half of them werent going upanyhow do we know who that last pilot was  i prefer a canon answer but anything would do  im curious,do we know who the last y-wing pilot was at the battle of yavin

523,starwars,all of marvels phase 4 and 5 movies are going to deal with some extremely out there premises wandavision and loki’s trailers prove that and are people upset over multiple timelines being setup no not at all it is probably looked forward to as much as any movies and shows have ever been so the sequel trilogy can most definitely be undone or at least just be a really really shitty bad dream universe separate from the one we all grew up with favreau filoni feigethe brains behind all 22 mcu movies so far and a dozen to come as well as a dozen shows george lucas and all the directors that have helped on the mandalorian are writing and developing a story that kathleen kennedy can only envy over and will try to rob us of considering she robbed us from jjs episode 8 and trevorows episode 9 as well as george lucass sequel trilogy who in there right mind has george lucas hand them an almost complete trilogy and tell the mastermind himself no thanks i think i can do better i mean omg if you don’t think the st is gonna be erased or at least swept under a rug to exist in some alternate reality which doesn’t affect the star wars fans want then you aren’t paying attention to what disney is doing with star wars not 1 i repeat not a single one of the 11 star wars shows announced a few weeks ago are going to be about the sequel trilogy these shows won’t be behind us until 2025 probably then what do you think disney is going to do all of a suddden make a rey or finn show hahaha i really doubt that filoni has delivered with the clone wars and rebels he has proven he can write amazing stories while having his hands tiedbc he has sw lore to adhere to the problem in kennedy’s eyes is dave filoni doesn’t look the part isn’t a woman and could care less what she wants bc he is only concerned with staying true to what lucas began all kennedy really has to do is set back and let them turn it around and she can come out of this as much as i would hate it in a good spot having helped return star wars to its peak i do not see that from her at all she just cannot stand people like ideas that aren’t hers the woke movement has good intentions at heart but a population isn’t much different then a 3 year old if you tell them to be one way they will most likely not listen bc no one wants told what to do however if they can be swayed that way by great storytelling in the subtlest way that’s fine with me all stories have morals it’s just stupid for kennedy to assume shoving the moral in our face before the story is even told “the force is female t shirts” will actually work has anyone thought about bill burr i guarantee kennedy didn’t want to hire him he is as anti woke as anyone i’ve ever heard from that’s just favreau rubbing his clout he has now in her face lmao john favreau is so much smarter then her so is filoni and so is feige here’s to a wonderful decade full of amazing star wars that in the process explains what was wrong with the sequels while simultaneously undoing them,after wandavision loki spiderman3 antman 3 and dr strange if well received the star wars universe will introduce a similar concept don’t forget that favreau and feige started iron man and the mcu  that is the same formula star wars has now the future is bright don’t be naive

539,starwars,the grysk hegemonyim sorry if someone has already posted something similar but ive looked before and couldnt find any theories on it so here is my ownfor those who dont know the grysk are a warlike species from the unknown region who for decades have been amassing a fleet to invade the galaxy in essence the grysk are disneys version of the yuuzhan vong who for those of you that are fans of star war legends brought untold destruction to the galaxymy theory is this: in the time between return of the jedi and the force awakens the grysk invaded the galaxy brought a similar level of destruction to the galaxy and the mandalorian is disneys way of introducing us to this new storyline first lets backtrack a bit the grysk are a species known by the chiss and brought to the attention of the empire by grand admiral thrawn in fact this was the premise of thrawn: alliances and thrawn: treason according to thrawn: treason the grysk has already begun making small advances into imperial territory in 1bby the same time as the final season of star wars: rebels in addition we know from these books that the chiss are either currently engaged or about to become engaged in a civil war which will be used to the grysks advantage adding to the grysks favor the galactic civil war causes the collapse of the empire which was perhaps the only military power capable of defeating themnow at the end of star wars: rebels grand admiral thrawn disappears with ezra to who-knows-where but we know from the mandalorian that he is not dead and that ahsoka is looking for him furthermore in the mandalorian when the new republic officer talks to cara dune he tells her that there is something going on out here and that no one in the core worlds believes it some might be inclined to believe that hes referring to the empire reorganizing itself into the first order but im more inclined to believe that its the empire or at least a remnant led by thrawn trying to strengthen itself against the gryskthe fact is the sequel trilogy takes place 35 years after return of the jedi and so there is no reason why the new republic wouldve let the first order build a superweapon like starkiller base during this time however what if the new republic was relatively powerless to stop the first order from rising because they were weakened while fighting the grysk the biggest piece of evidence i have for this is coruscant why is it that coruscant which was the home to the republic and the empire is not the capital of the new republic what makes hosnian prime so special that it replaces coruscant as the capital i believe that coruscant was attacked and even invaded by the grysk during their invasion similar to the vongs invasion of coruscant and so the new republic was forced to make hosnian prime its new capital this is further supported by the fact that we know that by the events of the force awakens coruscant had fallen into lawlessness and was overrun by criminals this would also explain why we never see coruscant in the sequels when yet we see other familiar planets/moons like endor and bespin--because disney didnt want to spoil itadding to my evidence are the newly announce ahsoka and rangers of the new republic tv shows both are set around the time of the mandalorian and so we can guess what the ahsoka show will be about--thrawn more importantly though this ahsoka show will most likely be our the viewer first introduction on-screen to the grysk and will be about ahsoka learning about them from thrawn and maybe even ezra if this is true then this will most likely lead to lukes new jedi order beginning to learn about the threat of the gryskhowever we have little news of rangers of the new republic but i believe it will deal with the new republic becoming aware of the grysk in fact according to disneys blog regarding the announcement of this show rangers and ahsoka will intersect with future stories and culminate into a climactic story event &lt;----the gryskits happening the grysk are coming and the galaxy will be in for a rude awakeningtl;dr: an unknown alien force known as the grysk is going to invade the galaxy between the events of rotj and the force awakens and disney has been keeping it a secret,spoilers/theory the mandalorian is the stepping stone into the next big storyline in the sw universe

574,starwars,hello everyonemy friend and i have decided to embark on rewriting and ironing out the kinks and mistakes in the star wars sequel trilogy we’ve identified the majority of big things that people don’t like from the different reviews complaints and forums but i wanted to ask for different things here we plan on putting the finished book s on archive of our own so it will be accessible to those who plan on reading it the main thing that we are changing is that we plan on going more into the first order the main complaint we’ve seen about them is that we don’t know anything about them we also plan on adding midichlorians into it backstory for finn rey no palpatine and ben we plan on cutting snoke out from the beginning and making kylo the supreme leader the force awakens: so we’re including midichlorians from the prequels the idea is that they’re trying to rebuild the jedi they make “clones” and use them as younglings ben is not strong with the force and has a lot of mental health issues that the adults in his life like to gloss over in the movies it’s revealed that luke saw the darkness in ben’s heart and tried to kill him- which makes no fucking sense but i won’t get into it in our rewrite ben tries to kill himself the skywalkers have a blood curse that prevent them from being killed by anyone who isn’t of their bloodline but it makes their blood toxic ben in his haze assumes that luke was trying to kill him and runs away to join the first order that’s more like communism in theory than how it was used he becomes a sort of anti-hero portrayed as a villain because the resistance comes in and wipes out the majority of the younglings to end the jedi because they’re corrupt as shit and he gets the blame for it rey and finn are two of the younglings who escape ben finds them he’s about 10 years older than them and puts rey on her planet and takes finn in as a stormtrooper the force awakens is basically the same from therei’d love to get any opinions on the ideas and plot- any characters or ideas from other star wars media that you think would be cool to add thanks in advance,rewriting the sequels

588,starwars,,what happened to darth mauls lightsaber 
589,starwars,lets get one thing straight i used to believe anakin did nothing wrong as it was because of the circumstances the jedi put him in he was backed into a corner and had no choice but i went into group therapy for a year where they specialize in preventing domestic violence and one of the things i learned in the class are these forms of control and power along with abusing the person youre with - blaming minimizing and denial blaming is when you put the blame of your actions onto somebody or something else - the way many people blame the jedi order for anakins actions and turn to the dark side minimizing is when you minimize an action you do for instance if you closed fist punch someone in the face you say i only smacked you in the face it wasnt that bad and i think we all know what denial is - its when you straight up deny your actions i didnt punch you what are you talking about youre crazy due to this i learned to take responsibility for my actions it doesnt matter what anybody or anything does i am water not soda if you shake a bottle of water nothing happens if you shake a bottle of soda it explodes  basically it shouldnt matter that the jedi kidnapped anakin and took him away from his mom never trusted him always looked down on him etc none of that is a justificatory reason for anakins horrific actions in real life if anybody killed a school of children i highly doubt any anakin defenders would jump onto defending this cold hearted horrible individual so why is anakin so defended he not only killed an entire school of young padawan who are all children between the ages of like 5-10 and on top of that he is worse than hitler come on dude issued the death star which destroyed an entire planet he slaughtered probably hundreds of thousands of people and nothing and i mean nothing justifies that action how would you feel if someone decided to randomly destroy earth and all of its inhabitants kill off all of your friends family people you will never meet now who could change your life and if you dont care about humans and care more about pets anakin killed all your dogs all your cats all your lizards and snakes and fish and literally every single thing on the planet how are people defending this monster i dont get it anymore dude is a pure and utter horrific monster anakin skywalker is not darth vader because guess what they are the same person and this can be seen as blaming again which is a means of power and control anakin luke everybody who defends anakin puts the blame on darth vader anakin didnt do it darth vader did yeah no that doesnt work anakin is darth vader and anakin killed millions dont put the blame on some made up person and take responsibility for your actions anakin sorry for the long rant but i feel this must be said its important to ones livelihood to have a good mental health and seeing anakin as a good person isnt really healthy and i would know because i wasnt mentally healthy when i believe anakin did nothing wrong,anakin skywalker - why do people defend this horrible person

604,starwars,,picture i took on dathomir
605,starwars,i really liked the last jedi it gave a new feel in the sw universe and really showed the war that is in star wars however there were 3 things plot wise that i cant roll over and accept i believe if these things were addressed in a minor edit the movie might be more widely accepted rather a movie like tros which needs a whole new cut to be salvaged1 poe and leias character arcpoes whole arc in tlj is to learn to be less a one man super warrior focused on the objective and more a commander whose focused on the lives of his comrads leia tries to teach him this by expressing how many lives including the bombing fleet were wiped out  and those casualties shouldve been avoided by fleeing the fight later in the movie they land on a base on crait and poe is still thinking about his failure problem is the dreadnought can wipe out bases with a single shot from orbit as they did with the resistances first base in the beginning of the film so if poe did not risk the lives of the bombing fleet and destroy the dreadnought husk/kylo ren couldve just ordered the dreadnought to blow up the crait base from orbit now all of this couldve been fixed with a simple line like this old base is so reinforced not even a dreadnought blast can take it down cheesy yes but it leaves audience members like me not questioning whether poe was right all along2 finn and roses bogus adventurei really like both of these characters yet i felt half of the film was spent on an adventure with no real pay out mainly for the plot convenience of having 2 main characters not stay on the ship it felt like one of those tv shows where they send half the cast on an adventure that episode just for it to lead to nothing and serve as no consequence to the greater show i felt like every point they tried to establish either fell flat or most importantly had no pay off in the film or in tros rose tries to explain to finn not to run away ending his timid character arc that is fixed in the first 5 minutes of them meetingrose tries to tell finn that the nice things in the galaxy are probably just rich people abusing their wealth and power never going back to this thoughtdj explains to finn that the good guy vs bad guy thing is wrong that people are not just one or the other and the same people selling your equipment sells to the fo as well never bringing this great philosophical point up againthey meet a slave kid who is force sensitive and gives him a resistance ring the kid later stares in the sky at the end of the movie and shows the audience hes force sensitive only for the movies to abandon him and this plot entirelythey fail the entire 40+ minute mission of getting the code breaker wrong guy and get captured but its fine because we had a different plot going on the whole time with trying to make it to crait it just felt like a terrible side story with no pay off or message that is throughly embedded if they hammered one of these points in the whole adventure or just gave a plot payout for those characters for taking the adventure other than the plot convenience of being on the supreme ship to have a rematch with phasma i wouldve accepted the entire adventure 3 luke forgets about redemptioni really like hermit luke as far as im aware hermit luke was even in george lucas original drafts of ep 7/8 because he didnt want the main hero coming in and wiping away the new heroes problems what i absolutely despised was the 3 version flashback of how ben became kylo it makes perfect sense that luke looses his order and goes to exile because he feels responsible it does not make sense that luke skywalker the man who spent an entire movie trying to convince the galaxys #1 murderer to become good again sees a dark vision of his wannabedarthvader nephew and decides to kill him in his sleep its just not in his character to do that even if ben was in the middle of his blitzkrieg of the galaxy luke would still try to convince him of returning to the light immediately giving up on his family member because of a chance/ a vision of the future is ridiculous for his character look these are a few things that really bug me from the writing perspective because some things in the film happen purely for plot convenience rather than ultimate payoffs which a long running universe like sw always is good at see mandalorian unfortunately i see having a one man rian johnson director/writer be the problem even in the bts of tlj you can see luke and rian arguing about the direction of the character and rian says something along the lines of i get how you feel but just do the story as its written for you if a writer is stuck in his head with a grand story idea with so much going on he looses perspectives that other writers shouldve called him out on like i said with minor dialog edits and maybe a cut or two tlj would stand as one of the bests imo it doesnt need a massive overhaul or reedit like tros,rant: the last jedi is a good movie but needs some serious edits

670,starwars,,im so sorry
671,starwars,so in both legends and canon palpatine has 2 different peaks of power his power during the dark empire comics and his power during the rise of skywalker movie we don’t have a ton to go off of for him in canon but from what we can see is palpatine more powerful in dark empire or the rise of skywalker bonus question: how do these versions compare to palpatine in revenge of the sith or return of the jedi,was palpatine stronger in dark empire or the rise of skywalker
672,starwars,hello therei’ve been a fan of the series for a while but i’ve only watched the movies where should i begin in terms of the other animated series’s and tv showsnote that the prequels are my favourites and especially revenge of the withmany thanks,where do i start
673,starwars,guys i am a little confused i want to watch the mandalorian but i thought i should watch the clone wars and rebel shows first but now that i have started those shows it feels like they will take a lot of time to finish so can i watch mando before i finish them or will that take something away from the experience  would i get characters like bo and ahsoka what should i do ,help required
674,starwars,though i only found the sequels mediocre at best and really bad at some points at worsti feel like theres a lot of potential in the sequels to be expanded upontake the sith eternal for examplesure the movie pretty much tells you that theyre all dead and buriedbut just because 1 hideout of sith cultists on 1 planet in the middle of nowhere in the unknown region is destroyedthat doesnt mean that the whole freaking thing is just goneunless the sith eternal is only on exegol then in that case im dumb plusi dont think we see the more esoteric and fanatical side of the empire/imperial remnant enough seeing an imperial remnant like the sith eternal is very interesting in my opinion i kind of want them to bring the sith eternal back i want them to fight not only the new republicbut also other imperial remnants too we already know in legends that there was an imperial civil war so why not take that and put that into canonbesides stormtroopers and rebels may hate each other but no one likes a heavily armed belligerentangry cultistno matter what side youre ontl;dr i want disney to expand on the sith enteral,a look into the future for the sequel era

714,starwars,,happy new years
715,starwars,what do you guys think the old republic era should look like in the new canon im probably gonna get a lot of crap for this but personally i hope lucasfilm/disney dont feel pressured to be 100% faithful to legends regardless of how you feel about the new canon we know that the old eu was much less organised in comparison so sometimes youd get designs that look out of place in the sw universe some that look simply terrible and at its worst you get both specifically im talking about things like:*  jedi \- why does this guy look like a mandalorian with jedi robes stylistically it looks like generic modern sci-fi à la halo or destiny instead of something ralph mcquarrie or doug chiang would design * republic troopers \- they had more than a 1000 years of evolution to consider and the best they could come up with is something that looks like an advanced phase 2 clone trooper  * darth bane \- this is probably the best example the new canon version we got is 100 times better than the weird power rangers villain they had in the old eui think the main issue is that they didnt really think about the artistic and cultural influences of the original designs by mcquarrie chiang lucas etc so a lot of things ended up looking very uninspired,old republic aesthetic and design in the new canon
716,starwars,the rebel alliance are divided and some of their actions are worse than you think to the point that if you read tales from jabbas palace did you believe boba fett was right about them not starting the warif they didnt casualties would not have piled up to the likes of galen saw chirrut jyn cassian bodhi  baze etceven though what he said was from legends he is right since restoring the republic allowed more conflicts to rise up like the yuuzhon vong galactic alliance guard krayts empire first order etcthe republic may have gotten better but it keeps getting worse the moment another threat comes outheck boba fett believes that the empire brought forth the very order to the galaxy by exterminating the jedi and the republics corruption and even if they had remained intact had palpatine were to be alive he would have no problem handling the upcoming yuuzhon vong threat and whatever is coming to him the republic/rebel alliance/jedi should have just stayed quiet to the point that it would all be over in seconds thanks to palpatinehow many of you are in alignment with the empire,after watching rogue one did you agree with what boba fett said regarding that the rebel alliance should not have started the war in tales from jabbas palace
717,starwars,,happy new year
718,starwars,,times the new year with the exploding of the death star

730,starwars,,i’m new to collecting but here’s my lightsaber collection
731,starwars,just think about it we can go two wayslinear version that follows roughly the show:this would start a little before chapter one we follow roughly the same story add a few more side quests if you’re feeling it at the same time make it a customizable experience if someone can fly the razor crest well enough then make it possible to avoid crashing on the spider planet from season 2 some larger choices would be things like choosing to shoot ig or not the open world element would be traveling from planet to planet at will as well as large maps for each planet similar to fallen order with a larger sandbox elementnew story new hero:make an open world star wars with either a different mandalorian or even a different character entirely just make sure they’re a loner in the galaxy preferably a bounty hunter add ship customization armor swapping and adding a scrapper feature would be fun players could find old clone armor and “scrap” it to fit there overall look as well as an option to do the same with your shipgood idea bad idea yell at me in the comments,we need an open world mando game
732,starwars,,2021 this is the way
733,starwars,in return of the jedi during yodas final moments he says that once hes gone luke will be the last jedi alive but is this actually correct i mean even though ahsoka wasnt a jedi anymore and hadnt been for a long time she was still around cal kestis and cere junda might still be alive but that remains unknown for now and ezra bridger seems to still be around so luke might not be the last jedi during royj but maybe yoda just thought that by that point every other jedi was dead which would have made him think that luke was really the last jedi but thats just my guess,was luke the last jedi in rotj
734,starwars,,i am having a 2021 party chat comment if you want to join

757,starwars,while not every change to the original trilogy that was made in the special editions was perfect there were some parts that made it feel more connected to the rest of the films like replacing the actors of the emperor and boba felt in episode 5 so that it’s the same throughout the series so what about minor changes to the sequel trilogy things like like rey or kylo ren having visions or hearing the voice of the emperor in their mind but not knowing who it is at the time something that just makes the trilogy feel more connected but would be relatively easy to add in i know some comics like “the rise of kylo ren” give us some of that but if your just going off the films i think it’d be a nice addition thoughts,thoughts on special editions of the sequel trilogy

784,starwars,i’ve seen a lot of people talking about how they don’t like how rey and kylo ren were using force heal out of no where so i thought i would explain it force healing is a dark side power and that’s why it’s not commonly taught or used by the jedi force healing is also not a new power it’s first mentioned in episode 3 the ability to save people from dying palpatine spoke of was force healing the only reason rey knows how to force heal is because she read the ancient jedi texts those books where written long before the jedi had an anti dark side stance the only reason kylo ren knows how to force heal is because luke taught him howluke tapped into the dark side on some occasions like when he force choked jabba’s guards or when he crushed a dark trooper on mando recently luke based his teachings on what yoda taught him and what he learned from the ancient texts it also takes extreme amounts of power to be able to force heal that’s why kylo dies when he force heals rey he never finished his training that’s also why we only know luke anakin palpatine darth plagueis leia rey and kylo had the ability or the potiential to force heal,why rey and kylo ren used force heal

811,starwars,thank you guys gals and grogusi’ve been a fan of sw since i first watched anh in 1997 but it was always a casual fan see the movies in the theaters get the dvd’s and just enjoy every now and again because it’s star wars there was no other reason really 2020 was a lot understatement one plus side has been that it has allowed me to really explore my love for star wars i’m the kind of person that really gets into the lore of a galaxy like star wars but due to my own insecurities i always kind of kept it to myself anyway my roommate and i obviously watched the first season of the mandalorian and he saw the love i have for this universe so he pushed me to kinda just be open about it it’s amazing how much your love for something even deepens when your encouraged to share that so this year has really shown me not only how special this franchise is but also how communities like this subreddit are how the fans really make you appreciate it and act as a lens to see the beauty in everything from the cinematography to how shows like the clone wars  add to the main saga while expanding g the universe to how you can start seeing recurring themes moments etc its what i take george lucas to mean by when he said “it rhymes” it has made this year suck just a bit less and provided a point of joy familiarity and community to return to when we’ve all felt alone this year so thank you i am grateful for all of you and swmay the force be with 2021,2020 pandemic and a galaxy far far away

819,starwars,i could dedicate an entire post to how much i love filoni so no hate here i just get the feeling like some sw fans are giving him too much credit for the mandalorian yes he’s directed/written some episodes and he certainly has more of a hand in the show than other directors i also think he exec produces it as well all in all dave is definitely the #2 guy and has a ton of say in how the show plays out but i feel like people forget that it is jon’s show jon is the main writer and creator of the show and people are always posting stuff giving dave credit that really should be given to jon it’s not that i don’t want to give dave his due credit it’s just that i don’t want to overlook credit that should be given to jon all in all this is just something i’ve noticed and i don’t think people realize that it isn’t jon and dave’s show it’s jon’s show dave’s just right with jon and has a lot of input for the shows direction happy new year,i love dave filoni but stop giving credit for everything in the mandalorian when it’s jon favreau’s show

853,starwars,,the vader twins wish you a happy new year
854,starwars,what do you think of him would you have done anything differently did he redeem himself in the end and can you blame him for what happened to him,how do you feel about anakin skywalker and how his story started and ended
855,starwars,good evening and happy new year to alli wanted to just take a minute and say something here luke skywalker as written by the sequel writers and directors was a do-nothing useless character he literally drank some milk talked to kylo ren from another planet and then died he drank milk talked and died he was supposed to be a hero a jedi a legend instead we got a milk-drinking nobody,luke skywalker
856,starwars,,3d scene i did of bo katan
857,starwars,,order 66 was justified the jedi deserved to get gunned down like animals #clonelivesmatter
858,starwars,,happy new years
859,starwars,,you underestimate my birthday cake
860,starwars,hey allso i dont know about you guys but since i was a kid i always wondered why the hell did vader fall when fighing luke in return of the jedi im not talking about when luke kicks him down the stairs but the moment right before he cuts off vaders hand if you look that duel carefully you notice that vader kinda simply gives up for no reason and stays there with his saber rised up and doing nothing i think you could say that he was overwhelmed by lukes fury and that might be the canon explanation if by chance there is one but i think that the actual reason was simply and unfortunately: bad coreography or to say it better: bad coreography execution let me explain why: if you look at the behind the scenes of that particular moment that footage wasnt used in the final cut of the movie though luke actually pushes vader on the railing and he falls becaus of being pushed naturally i think that when they shot the actual scene that we got mark hamill forgot to push vader aside but david prowse fell anyway and for some reason they kept it like thattheres actually the same problem in wrestling fights during the so called botches in which one of the two fighters behaves like he was hit despite the fact that the opponent accidentally didnt performe the move properlyso what do you guys think have you ever noticed this particular moment or is it just me,i think i know why vader fell when fighting luke in rotj
861,starwars,,thought someone here might be interested in my video :d
862,starwars,,my newly sewn star wars scrub caps for work

864,starwars,,this is absolutely amazing credit to original creator
865,starwars,its my first time watching the movies so maybe im wrong but i feel like some scenes just jump from one place to another as if they were cut short/incorrectly im watching on disney+ but no matter how many times i rewind certain scenes are just like that eg when leia is unfreezing han solo and jabba catches themdid anyone else notice and what is that,weird jumpcuts on disney+ in the new hope and return of the jedi

911,starwars,,mark hamil showing appreciation for being in the mandalorian
912,starwars,,all for the empire 😤
913,starwars,i know the title doesnt really make sense but what im trying to say is the movies always start with a long time ago so if all the star wars stories we know take place 100 years 1000 years 10000 years or how ever many years makes up a long time ago then what would life be like in those systems in modern day &amp;#x200b;im sorry this question is phrased horribly ive just always wondered if its ever been thought up or if there was any lore behind it,if star wars is set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away  then what would that galaxy be like modern day times
914,starwars,,i’ve had this image in my head for over a week i don’t paint very much i’m definitely not an artist but tatooine sunsets always give me the warm and fuzzies

920,starwars,//spoiler warning for the new trilogy and the mandalorian// first ill point out the most obvious example which is palpatine coming back from the dead as a clonethe old cannon had this very plotline except instead of using grogus dna they used lukes in my opinion using lukes dna makes even less sense as capturing luke seems way less believable than capturing grogusecondly we have the like the death star but bigger trope; this happened alot in legends a few notable examples are the star crusher and star destroyers outfitted with deathstar lasers which is basically identical to what we saw in the rise of skywalkerthe fact is that the original trilogy did not have a good opening for additional content at least not revolving around the characters from the original sagai think thats one of the reasons why the mandalorian did so well as main movie characters are mostly kept to a minimum luke only appears in one episode and by his time being brief it sticks to what is required for him to do save the day and take grogu for trainingboba fett is the only other movie character we see and he fits in because the format fits with his charactercombine these factors with the 30+ years of expectations from fans and i dont think we could have ever had a super good new trilogy involving the original charactersits a hard pill to swallow but theres only so much you can do with the fairly final ending that rotj left us with,alot of what people complain about with the new cannon was present in legends
921,starwars,,the mandalorian poster by simone ferraro

923,starwars,,my grogu enjoying breakfast 😋
924,starwars,,happy new year done with my friends u/coner3245
925,starwars,,uh-oh
926,starwars,the stormtroopers in this show give me flashbacks to watching star wars rebels  i dont think the empire killed or even injured a single character in season 2  every fight with stormtroopers is completely devoid of tension and theyre killed so often and so easily that you honestly start to feel sorry for them  i just dont think its a good idea to make your primary antagonists feel like barely more than a speed bump to your heroes  we all know that plot armor exists but a good writer/director will be able to make the audience forget about it  this show frankly does the opposite  especially in season 2its important for your villains to feel like a legitimate threat  as is watching mando and crew fight a bunch of stormtroopers is like watching mike tyson beat up a kid with cerebral palsy,does anyone else think the empire in the mandalorian is just a bit too useless
927,starwars,,got my hands on a 1979 boba
928,starwars,rewatching all star wars movies during lockdown i noticed something strange in the phantom menace   when obi-wan and qui-gon were on the trade federations ship obi-wan showed that he was able to use force speed when he and qui-gon got away from the droidekas  but when he and qui-gon were seperated during their battle with darth maul when the laser barriers opened he just sprinted normally and came up short at the last laser barrier  now why didnt he use force speed here too to make it in time and help qui-gon fight and maybe even defeat darth maul,obi-wans force-speed in the phantom menace
929,starwars,they were both in the rebellion and since luke destroyed the death star which previously destroyed her homeworld shouldn’t she have known right away who he was when he showed up logically when she saw him she should’ve been like “this guy is a hero stand down”,surely cara would’ve known who luke was
930,starwars,,heres a more accurate version for you perfectionist out there

955,starwars,obviously there was no jango when boba was first introduced so i know any such explanation would have been after ep2 but i was just curious if anyone recalls reading anything about why boba didnt use the full leg/boot armor from jangos armor,was it ever explained why boba didnt wear the full jango armor

957,starwars,i saw it three times in theaters  and i am not a theater goer and twice online i know i’m not the only one who thinks that movie nailed it i wonder how you’d describe why emotionally it feels more relatable than the prequels and more organized than the sequels; it makes me feel like i’m right there in the lead up to the ot and leaves me at the doorstep of my childhood; it leaves behind the politics and morals of the pq and sq and returns to the clear moral staging of good vs evil but there is more; something about the film itself and the cinematography grabs me and won’t let me go other r1 lovers: help me make words what about that one sets it apart for you,“rogue one” is my absolute favorite sw film outside of the original trilogy i know how it makes me feel but can’t articulate what cinematic qualities it possesses that set it apart can anyone articulate this for me

973,starwars, quick summary:**legends**: order 66 is one of 150 contingency order for the gar and the clones are shady from the start they know their true purpose and willingly execute order 66 the clones have unquestioning loyalty and murder their jedi generals in cold-blood the clones are completely aware of their actions **canon**: the clones are implanted w/ inhibitor chips at the earliest stages of their development when palpatine issues order 66 these chips activate and forces the clones to comply w/ order 66 the inhibitor chips takes away the clones’ agency and individuality**personal opinion**: i prefer the retcon canon version as its more logical prior to tcw the legends version made sense because the clones barely had any character development except for that they have unquestioning loyalty however tcw has portrayed the clones as individuals who developed personalities made decisions and defied orders they deemed wrong the jedi and clones developed strong bonds as tcw progresses also it’s cruel how the inhibitor chips takes away the clones’ agency and individuality,question - do you prefer the legends or canon version of order 66

979,starwars,hey all i was looking to find some information on the possible bisexuality of obi wan and i stumbled upon something interestingi found a tumblr post that mentioned that in the revenge of the sith novelization when palpatine is trying to turn anakin he tries to convince ani that obi wan is having an affair with a senator anakin asks palpatine who he is referring to the senator obi wan is rumored to have an affair withi couldnt find anything else about this and i dont have access to the novel so i was wondering if any of you could confirm this occuranceunfortunately this novel is no longer considered canon so even if the tumblr post is accurate i doubt obi wan is canonically bisexual but i can dream cant i theres a sliver of a chance it could happen in the upcoming miniseries,can someone confirm this revenge of the sith novelization

1003,starwars,so with the new show being entitled the book of boba fett are we implying that his exploits will end up written down somewhere in the galaxy far far away sort of like the book that lotr becomes have we ever seen “books” besides the sacred jedi textsis boba fett an aspiring author,is boba fett known for his writing
1004,starwars,when this got announced i sighed and thought oh look another one but ill say this about whats now the \*\3rd spin-off\\* to a 1-year old show:   morrison was excellent this season and did so much for that character more than theres been done - its not like hes just a guy in a cool costume he has a history a physicality and a voice and delivery that all give so much credence to that character i was already enamored with fett this season so its going to be great to get more of him in general   im hoping its not helmed completely by robert rodriguez i wish they took their time developing it and i wish james mangold was attached to it but - ill still give this a shot i think its one of the few newly announced series that actually feels earned,ill watch the boba fett show

1011,starwars,hey everyone ive been watching clone wars lately so im getting to know more and more of anakin so it hurts quite a bit to know just how much of a monster he was as vaderhow did things get there because i cant help but feel like it is super unnaturalnow i know star wars basically invented retcons but still if you had to justify the transition from a loving general who cared about literally every living being or droid he met to a genocidal maniac how would you do it what am i missing or should i just suspend my disbeliefthanks,how did vader get so vicious

1015,starwars,,darth vader has fought his son luke skywalker he’s defeated his master obi-wan kenobi but can he face himself hayden christensen stars as a sweaty gamer in this star wars sitcom special
1016,starwars,let’s face it star wars is very male dominated i think we can stick it the man and unite the fan base with a new generation of gals going about the universe on their own,if disney cares about prolonging star wars they need to do an all female reboot of the original trilogy
1017,starwars,• where did the first order find all the funds and money and people though is relatable for all the sequels• finn should have had a better story throughout the sequels•i really don’t think that han solo’s end would have been that•poe is a damn good pilot it would have been so cool if his name was antilles come on just imagine it i was super happy to se wedge again in the last film,i’ve just rewatched the force awakens and i couldn’t get these things out of my mind

1024,starwars,,i need help i want to buy this jacket for my boyfriend who loves star wars do you guys think he would like it
1025,starwars,so here i am going on the internoots with questions assuming ill find my answers because most things star wars have already been discussed ; but to my surprise im sent on a goose-chase with multiple leads and little evidence but then this :someone mentions it might have something to do with either the german *troopenkorps* or something like that - lucas loved german terms like *vader* for father or maybe that it referred to who the troops were assigned to / which unit theyre a part oflike say the isb agent kallus from rebels is isb-021 or drumroll tarkintk - and the reason we hear so many tk troopers is because tarkin was governor and later grand moff of the entire outer rim a huge part of the galaxy where a majority of post-yavin action happens ; and so i imagine its not out of the question that the empire might have given tarkins letters of tk as the regional designation for the outer rimother far-fetched theories of mine include more planet-based designations - like again in rebels the troopers designated ls-515 or ls-005 might have stood for lothal service&amp;#x200b;other designations include lrc-// or mb-/// - any ideas what those could mean ,stormtrooper identification system i think
1026,starwars,,he played star wars space battle in rolbox
1027,starwars,i know grievous did have orders not to kill the chancellor but let’s say he would be allowed to if the jedi were getting close would palpatine be able to defend himself would he just reveal himself to be the mastermind or would grievous be able to kill palpatine without much issue,could general grievous have killed palpatine in rots
1028,starwars,is there something definitive and in-canon that shows us palpatine wasnt darth bane   he successfully transferred his consciousness to zannah and i would assume he would only get better at it each time  this could explain how the sith continued to get stronger and stayed on mission  youd think a different sith over the centuries mightve deviated from banes original plan,darth bane
1029,starwars,,got a couple of late christmas gifts these are my first star wars books and hopefully the start of a new collection
1030,starwars,this is my personal star wars viewing order primarily for new comers* rouge one* a new hope* the empire strikes back* the phantom menace* attack of the clones* the clone wars* revenge of the sith* the bad batch* solo* rebels* return of the jedi* the mandalorian/the book of boba fett/ashoka/rangers of the new republic* resistance optional* the force awakens* the last jedi* the rise of skywalker,my personal star wars viewing order
1031,starwars,i know that you shouldn’t fix something that isn’t broken but i do see room for improvement on the venator personally i would put a row of heavy turbo lasers on the ventral side of the ship and position them in a similar way to the heavy dorsal guns more ion weapons could as be highly beneficial against droid adversaries what would you do,how would you upgrade a venator class star destroyer
1032,starwars,i just noticed it today on disney +,when did they change jango fetts jetpack in attack of the clones to look like bobas jetpackm

1041,starwars,in my opinion still one of the top 10 best multiplayer shooter games ever created star wars jedi knight two combined elements or lightsabers force powers a variety of gadgets and blasters especially since we saw the unveiling of dark troopers in star wars canon in the mandelorian single player stories was fun and interesting following the journey of a former imperial operative turned rebel alliance mercenary then his discovery of force sensitivity leading to a path to becoming a jedi kyle katarn and jan his counterpart was the original operatives who stole the deathstar plans they faced off against imperial inquisitors the dark troopers project imperial remnants trying to create force sensitive soldiers and cultists trying to resurrect ancient sith lordsthen when jedi knight two: jedi outcast was released the multiplayerjustwow incredible and still one of the best balanced competitive multiplayer games ever created and could stand toe to toe with apex legends overwatch quake all of the quick paced multiplayer shooters team deathmatch capture the flag was multidimensional and interesting due to the simultaneous use of force powers lightsabers weapons and gadgets first person shooter switching back and force to third person lightsaber combatforce powers were balanced neutral lightside and darkside to choose from blasting out force lightning force pushing pulling enemies off ledges or holding back flag runners force choking and lifting enemies off deadly falls blocking blaster bolts was automatic depending on if you werent swinging around your lightsaber different weights of use and attacking simplistic lightsaber use no showboating lightsaber combo attacks jedi knight 3 jedi academy featured some after also introducing double bladed or dual wielding lightsabers you could force throw your lightsaber like a boomerangthen there were the weapons and gadgets like portable turrets deflector shield screens mines then the weapons the absolutely wonderful variety with secondary firing modes personal favorite was the tl-50 imperial repeater with the secondary concussion blasts {btw ea/ dice thank you for bringing that back in battlefront two i was ecstatic seeing that gem} force powers had offensive and defensive use in conjunction with weapons i could force push away rocket launcher rockets or id fire concussion blasts at an opposing teams base and my buddy was propelling them further with force push use force speed run circles around enemies while going full auto with my e-11 blaster this game needs a comeback especially with todays technology and physics maybe even see what crazier simultaneous force power and blaster use can do with new physicsnot as clumsy or random as a todays games; an elegant multiplayer fps for a more civilized age 🤣 i know a lot of us fans would love to see all this make a comeback keep jedi knight as simple as it used to be with the exception of some new game engine tech for more destructible environments and world physics keep it mostly the samei truly think the force sensitive mercenary kyle can be brought back whether its a fallen order situation of him becoming a merc or perhaps escaping the knights of rens temple massacre further up the timeline and making a living as a mercenaryfavreau and filoni gave the fandom exactly what they wanted last season of mando its time star wars gaming gets the same love of being made by fans for fans knowing what the others want if you want to microtransction different skins weapons and characters lightsaber hilts or beams/ colors fine nothing that unbalances the game and keeps its original spirit,we need a canocal reimagining of one of the eus most iconic heros and a reboot of their games im talking kyle katarn and sw: jedi knight

1052,starwars,,order 66 on new years
1053,starwars,**revenge of the sith** 7/10 this was the first star wars movie i saw brothers told me the first 2 episodes of the prequels suck so we skipped i thought it actually did make sense even without the context of the first 2 overall the movie was wildly entertaining but extremely cheesy i was making fun of anakin and palpatine for most of the movie and not really taking it seriously i love obi-wan though hes hilarious in general this is such a fun movie i get why people love it **rogue one** 6/10this could be a hot take but i didnt find this movie to be that great the main characters were just dull in my opinion which sort of prevented me from caring about the story its definitely a lot more well made than revenge of the sith just not nearly as much fun  i will say the final 30 minute battle at the end of this movie is amazing  **a new hope** 9/10 this is the movie that made me realize why these movies are popular in the first place now i see why the originals are so much more beloved the first 2 acts of this movie built up the intrigue to insane levels and i found myself hooked on star wars han solo and princess leia were easily the best characters in my opinion and definitely carried the movie i dont think luke by himself would be that entertaining as a main character but i did love his escapades on tattooine and mos eisley though i will say the third act wasnt nearly as strong as the first 2 acts of this movie **empire strikes back** 10/10 this movie was amazing han and leia my favorite characters had such epic banter through the whole movie and their journey as fugitives from the empire was entertaining as hell the scenes with luke did drag a bit in my opinion but yoda was funny and made it work once luke finally goes to cloud city the movie really picks up to a great 3rd act i cant really think of any significant flaws with this movie its extremely air tight and the characters shine so bright in this **return of the jedi** 6/10 this might be a hot take but i was underwhelmed by this movie the jabbas palace sequence was cool plus the final showdown between luke and palpatine / vader was awesome however this movie felt sort of like a repeat of new hope plus i felt a lot of the dialgoue just wasnt quite as snappy or clever especially the scenes with han and leia overall its a decent movie and a good ending to the original trilogy but they could have done so much more with this **force awakens** 6/10 this movie definitely had awesome visuals and set pieces but right after watching new hope and return of the jedi it just felt like another movie where the heroes destroy the death star i didnt particularly resonate with the characters nearly as much as i did with the characters in a new hope and empire either  so yeah those are my thoughts on all the ones i saw overall i definitely get the appeal of these movies especially the original two movies with that said it seems like to me they sort of ran out of ideas a long time ago and at this point are just cashing in,just finished my first ever star wars marathon here are my thoughts as a 25 year old who watched them for the first time
1054,starwars,,just got this in the mail can’t believe i somehow got it for less than $200
1055,starwars,just curious do you think they will reenact or extend obi-wan vs maul fight from rebels show or not in my opinion it looked like theyve wasted this confrontation there as it shouldve happened in a live action show considering how iconic this conflict is between these two characters thoughts,spoilers do you think maul vs obi-wan will happen in kenobi show
1056,starwars,after return of the jedi new edit ending we see anakin obiwan and yoda together as ghosts  in the clone wars we learn that yoda is taught how to keep his spirit alive after death  we also see that yoda tells a young obiwan to learn this power while hes in exile  in the prequels palpatine tells anakin he cannot learn this power from a jedimy question:  has it been written shown or proven that enough time elapsed between the transformation of anakin to darth and return of the jedi for palpatine to have taught him this power to make the ending of this movie plausibledoes this in any way make the completely ridiculous resurrection of princess leah possiblethanks,question about anakin and palpatine coming back after death

1117,starwars,i don’t like the sequels but i don’t mind if other people do if you enjoy all movies i’m happy for you - and a little jealous bc i want to love all of them too but episodes 8 &amp; 9 just don’t sit right with mei’m just curious because i don’t get it it’s always tlj and rian johnson but tros is just as bad the whole movie is rushed the plot is too fast paced and there’s no logic or explanation behind random happenings whatsoever it’s not good as sw but it also fails as a movie and still every time when the sequels come up it’s tlj’s fault that the trilogy is badat least the message of tlj was good let the past die and you don’t have to be someone’s relative to be strong with the force tros on the other hand totally lacks meaning hux’s and ben’s turn came out of the blue palpatine’s return is so uncalled for and he - the most powerful and feared being in the galaxy - dies in the most stupid way imaginable and there’s not one character arc that goes in any direction but at least we learn that you can be good even as a force sensitive clone’s daughter oh and also the fanservice in the movie doesn’t work at allso why is tlj getting more hate because it was the first of the two bad movies is that all or is there something else i can’t seei hope this didn’t sound like a rant it was not my intention just looking for answersi wish everyone a happy new year may the force be with you,why tlj gets much more hate than tros

1125,starwars,very few people on this planet understand that star wars is very if not completely similar to what is happening here next to that since everyone is connected to the creational power of the universe or force i am 100% sure starwars universe is real somewhere else in the galaxy maybe another era dont believe me the galaxy is far too big for your human mind to comprehend the possibilities of it yet its very logical resistance to believing this comes from you feeling like an ant on this planet working for money and dying later also being in a materialistic environment makes you blind to what really is happeningmany abilities that are described in starwars are 100% real persuasion telepathy force push aka tk enhanced physical traits clairvoyance manipulating luck one of the greatest attaining eternal life aka retaining your intact consciousness and individuality when dying and returning to the force as you know a few jedi masters can dothe force is real here we call it something else its just a word to point out to something basically it is in everything as it is everything light side dark side its in all of you and its also selfish bullshit like the jedis and siths do to argue their way as the only way there is only the force and nothing but the force after that; you can use it as you like its completely neutral jedis and siths are just like you guys judging each other but again there is only the creative power that animates everything in the universe things just areagain very few are aware of this but i am i wonder if there are other force sensitives here im definitely born with a sensitivity to it and im sure i am not alone i have really cool experiences with the force and i am here to push it even further to the limit also force sensitivity is present in everything and everyone as i have seen people debate on reddit if everyone can be a jedii do know everyone has it in them but what i do not understand is why others like me are way more in tune with it and willing to develop that part all the rest of the people on this planet seem to sleep,force sensitivity fiction is reality -change my mind
1126,starwars,,planning to start clone wars should i watch the movie before the series
1127,starwars,me and my friend were playing and we were put back to level 0 on everything but we still had the star cards but they did nothing and we went into several matches and some people had this and other people didn’t did anyone else have this we couldn’t find anything on it but many people had it so who here had it and who knows how to fix it,on battlefront 2 we were put back to 0 levels on everything
1128,starwars,,are there two different types of venators with different hangar bays
1129,starwars,i know with the new canon about inhibitor chips vs the old battlefront canon of following orders that there has been a huge debate about why the clones would turn on the jedi but thats when i realized something what if the mistake were all making is viewing things through our own moral lens we find it unthinkable for clones who are friends of the jedi to kill them because death is horrible but what if we were raised from birth to fight and not be afraid of death what if the clones willingly killed the jedi because in their minds death wasnt that bad we see clones try their hardest to save their friends but what if that is less about dying and more about fighting till the end if we actually take a second to consider how they were raised and their environment then killing their friends and commanders makes a lot of sense in their minds the jedi dying for the republic just isnt that big a deal what if the real source of guilt as seen in battlefront 2 is just the idea of shooting fellow soldiers/breaking the command structure and the murder aspect isnt even considered i seriously wonder if the clones would mind in the slightest if they trained against each other with lethal rounds so long as they did it with the idea of becoming stronger soldiers,order 66 explanation

1137,starwars,so i’m just sitting here today and i enjoy the star fighter scenes and the game squadrons when something hit me if we think canonically how do the rebels star-fighter get their names like x-wing y-wing and so on in the star wars universe the common alphabet is called aurebesh which is symbolic alphabet not unlike the english one but with no common symbols if you look at the aurebesh alphabet the corresponding letter to the english ones near no comparison ie the corespondent of aurebesh to x looks like a squareso really if you think about it where are the terms x y b u a and so on coming from in the star wars universe to be used in order to name the ships after food for thoughtanywho happen new years eve to all you crazy bothans,how do the rebel star-fighters get their names

1198,starwars,fan fiction ending for the last jedi that i think would have been totally unexpected while also giving fans some things they wanted to see enjoyit begins right after kylo and rey finish fighting the praetorian guards kylo makes roughly his same speech to rey you are no one but not to me he reaches out his hand rey conflicted instantly knows how she feels about ben but she also knows how she feels about what he has done thinking to herself no hes a monster hes done things that cant be forgiven she fights what she feels because she knows he has done things that would undermine her own identity if she permitted herself to overlook them but something strange has happened in the time that they have shared in this inexplicable force connection she now knows his mind as if it was her own the force has bonded their souls into one she can feel the very suffering abandonment betrayal and rage that lead him to his actions the sick jester of the rippling circumstances over which he had no control this visceral pain sat with her like an old friend it was a pain she was all too familiar with she had known it as a dark passenger all her life but never had the power to rectify it who is she to say that if she had had the power kylo had had since birth that she would not have seeked similar retributionshe now doubts herself who she really isher mind her very identity is now being crushed under the weight of this conflict so much uncertainty confusion struggle yet standing across from her ben she is utterly certain what she feels about ben the crystalline shine of this diamond like clarity feels like the light compared to the turmoil she feels fighting its overwhelming allure every fiber in her being wants to reach out to him in her mind why am i fighting so hard to deny myself everything i have ever wanted this it is everythingand it really is to a scavenger like her her entire life she has been nothing to anyone else shes never had a family shes never had power or money and here is a man reaching out his hand to her offering her everything that shes ever wanted love companionship power an existence where she will never have to eek by on 1/4 rations again all the things she used to lie awake at night dreaming of having are at her fingertips now all she has to do is reach out and take it hesitant at first but then decisively she takes his hand ben they embrace in a passionate kiss as if their whole lives have been a painful and confusing prison of suffering until this very moment and in this kiss their shackles are dissolved the scene then changes and they are in a bed chamber ben and rey are shown to be making love not in an exploitative way but in a symbolic way of showing their bond being cemented in something they both never thought possible complete and total acceptancefast forward in the film and the rebel base standoff scene is playing out similarly to how it played out in the movies rey is now by kylos side in the at-at luke is actually physically present leaving shortly after rey left realizing the mistakes he had made after speaking with yoda and wishing to rectify them after trying to blow luke up with blaster fire and failing kylo looks at rey we can only defeat him if we stand together they go out to meet luke in the open and barren field kylo confronts luke about his failures as a master and how he betrayed him you made a mockery of your own teachings trying to take my life as a boy before i even had the chance to live luke says i know it must seem that way but i didnt mean you any harm rey jumps in liar i believed you on the island because i wanted to believe you or in the legend of you but now i have seen the truth of what you did who you really are i see it now as if through my own eyes i know now that you were going to kill him luke perspective can be misleading young rey search your feelings you know you have chosen the easy path rey shut up i will not hear any more deceit luke turns to ben i know i failed you ben im sorry ben sarcastic anger im sure you are rey you betrayed ben you betrayed the jedi and now youve failed for the last time at that moment rey springs into action followed closely by kylo and an epic lightsaber battle ensues the battle is close but rey and kylo are slowly starting to overwhelm luke for he is only a pale shadow of his former self out of practice and old luke struggles mightily but even now is still able to defend himself and put up a valiant fight against the onslaught of the much younger foes using bad ass force abilities to make up for his less than agile older frame luke resists the best he can try as he might kylo and rey slowly push luke back toward the entrance of the rebel stronghold at that moment near the precipice of the entrance right as luke looks as if he is going to be overwhelmed seemingly out of nowhere leia force leaps into the frameleia defensively engages rey and kylo briefly with her saber kylo stops fighting stunned at seeing his own mother seemingly attack himleia briefly crouches down in a ball summoning all of her energy and focus along with all of the pain and sadness she feels seeing her own son try to kill her brother the air swirls around her suddenly it goes quiet a moment of suspense as suddenly she floats in the air stretches out her body and cries out a blood curdling scream unleashing an enormously powerful force push blast rey and kylo go flying back hundreds of feet leia collapses from the exertion and luke quickly grabs her and pulls her into the base they run half hazardly supporting each other toward where the resistance is hiding near the back of the entrance of the cave luke then sets leia down and puts both his hands outstretched above his head he summons all of his force energy in immense concentration the mountain itself creaks and cracks dramatically but nothing happens then slowly leia gets up looks at luke and says lets do this they then work together to use the force to collapse the entrance to the base pulling the mountain down on itself  sealing the rebels inside but more importantly sealing kylo and rey outleia says assertively come on there has to be a way out a resistance fighter yells theres not we already checked and luke says there has to be you understand the resistance fighter nods nervously realizing the gravity of the situation they are in leia and luke then lead the resistance to the back of the base searching for a way outsuddenly finn spots an ice coyote wiggling his way through some rocks guys i think i found something luke and leia come over to observe finn we can get out this way use the force to move the rocks luke and leia look at each other knowing they dont have the strength to move the giant boulders after their massive exertion but before they can deliver the bad news there is a loud and blinding explosion bang once the dust settles to their surprise they see chewie waiting for them hovering low in the falcon this whole time chewie had been systematically checking for weak spots in the back of the mountain to see if he could find a way for them to escape chewie lands the falcon and emerges with a porg on his shoulder the porg has ruffled feathers looking discheveld and beside himself like it had just been though something traumatizing yet funny chewie and luke embrace as the resistance loads into the falcon chewie says something in wookie along the lines of i knew youd find your way back luke chuckles and replies guess this makes it 3 times i owe you pal they then all load into the falcon and speed off into hyperspace and the resistance survives to fight another daythats it hope you enjoyed the read go easy on me im not much of a writer but i had fun making it if theirs enough interest ill write another one with my idea on how this story line would be concluded in the next movie thank you for reading,what if rey turned to the dark in the last jedi fan fiction
1199,starwars,i was having my morning walk today thinking about star wars as one does and a thought came to my mindepisode 9 could have been better if nothing was changed besides instead if the emperor the main villain was thrawn you could change only the emperor’s scenes and the one where kylo tells rey that she is palpatine’s granddaughter everything else would fit quite nicely even the emperor’s message which would be a total thrawn move to makewhat are your opinion my friends,just a random thought

1244,starwars,,with rumours of mara jade going around which eu characters do you guys want to see in the live-action series
1245,starwars,it would be amazing if right now along with all of the other upcoming sw related announcements that dave and jon were at the helm of a new sequel trilogy for sw disney did it right with rogueone and solo imo but man were 7-9 a disappointing story line and useless characters,i wish disney would have just done the anthology rogue one/solo movies and we were still anticipating the sequel trilogies 7-9 post clone wars/mando
1246,starwars,don’t get me wrong these pre-anh and post-rotj shows/movies are some of the most amazing aspects of star wars but i can’t help but wonder what characters like ahsoka and cal kestis if he’s still alive or even palpatine were up to during the days of the death stars although not as necessary since the ot is far sturdier than the prequels i’d love to get some sorts of shows/books/games to account for the recent characters’ whereabouts during that time period i’d even like to see something like shadows of the empire but i guess i could just go read shadows of the empire this isn’t meant as a complaint but just an idea that i haven’t seen much of or maybe i’m just petty lol,is anyone else interested in getting some original trilogy-era content
1247,starwars,,every starfighter from star wars: squadrons explained
1248,starwars,fandom hatred is one idiotic phenomenon which honestly infuriates medo not get me wrong there are cases when authors/creators get “unintended fans” of their work such as ‘my little pony: friendship is magic’ and cases when people are only in the business of creating entertainment media for the sake of money fame and “spreading of ideologies” without any actual care for the fans there are even cases in which the original creators themselves have decided to make changes in their works which fans may disagree with such as ‘the last of us’with that said who in their bloody right mind actively antagonises the people who are basically giving them money for watching/reading/playing their worksi get it it is impossible please everyonethat said it should be perfectly possible to be at the very least be civil/logical towards people who have disagreements with your works it should also be perfectly possible to treat the fandoms that you have gained such as ‘the last of us’ or have inherited from others such as disney inheriting star wars and marvel with respect care an understandingunfortunately it is clear that some people cannot even exercise such basic human courtesyseriously real fans only want the fictional works that they love to be enjoyable/fulfilling/sensible/true the last time i checked most sane people do not appreciate being mocked or treated unfairly when they have actual reasons to be upset about a fictional work being handled poorly such as the ‘disney star wars sequels’to the people who hate the fandom because they refuse to blindly accept the unwanted changes in their beloved fictional works without putting a struggle you are no better than egotistical tyrants who refuse to listen to the cries of their people/fans,the idiocy of fandom hatred it is relevant to star wars given the issues over the past few years after the disney takeover

1254,starwars,,not sure if its been done before lmao
1255,starwars,random question that i thought of while having another discussion  in the mortis arc of clone wars the characters encounter the planet mortis with the father son and daughter powerful entities with tremendous command of the force  the son being almost a personification/avatar of the dark side and the daughter of the light side while the father seemed to be a balance of neutrality between the two holding them in check  at the end of the arc he is on his deathbed  having already spoken during the arc as if he was going to die he is mortally wounded by the sons machinations  the main characters then find themselves back on their ship their clocks prior to the time they landed on the planet in empty space with no planet mortis nor any evidence the events actually happened and werent a dream or force vision  it should be noted here that the imagery of the father son and daughter seems to be ancient among at least some force wielders as artwork depicting the three was found on lothal at an ancient jedi temple which eventually leads ezra to the portal of the world between worlds  the artwork was ancient but prevalent enough at least in ancient ruins that palpatines historian recognized it and was able to describe it even if admitting that the exact significance was unknown  fast forward to star wars: rebels and the founding of chopper base on attolan  there former jedi padawan kanan jarus meets a large nature-like being calling itself the bendu saying that there were the sides of the force such as the light and the dark but im the one in the middle  the bendu  he does not say those like me or my kind or anything that would suggest a general statement  while he could be referring to a class or order of being weve not seen nor encountered any others of his kind or his order or hisphilosophyto make that determination  like the father he seems to be some singular being dedicated to a peaceful existence and balance between light and dark rather than using either  to the point he refuses to take either side when thrawns imperial forces assault the rebels on the planet and when called a coward by kanan proceeds to become a storm and attack both sides  the only time he attacks only one side is when the rebels flee after he demands everyone leave his planet leaving only the imperials for him to attack  after a barrage of fire from thrawns forces sends him crashing to the ground in corporeal form he predicts thrawns future defeat even after being unable to predict whether ahsoka would die if she confronted vader and claims he is beyond thrawns ability to destroy when thrawn asked what manner of being he was  he then vanishes when thrawn shoots at the bendus fallen form only his laughter echoing indicating he had not been killed    while being arguably weaker than the father outright the bendu was force neutral and described himself like the father as a balance point between the two  like the father he was extremely wise and had an air of immortality or at least very extended life and a desire for peace and not engaging with petty or lesser or trifling matters likeyou know a major galaxy spanning civil war  like the father he did not seem entirely immortal and had at once both a corporeal and ethereal seeming existence  and like the father he seemed to be an enigmatic and singular being an anomaly in the universe somewhat akin to the character of tom bombadil in the lord of the rings aule theories aside  note that im not saying the bendu was the father or anything  more asking the question if they could bei dunno of a type of thing or somehow connected i guess  or perhaps that the bendu could have been an incarnation or corporeal branch of the father or something  while we do know the father was mortally wounded in the events on mortis as mortis seemed somewhat  from time we dont really know how long his death would have taken or even when it would have occurred in the outside universe similarly to how events in hyperspace are not exactly in sync with the normal/realspace galaxy so we do not know for certain if the father would be dead by the events of rebels or if he was even killed at all or any thing like that that would interfere with any potential connection with the bendu  anyway just wondering if anyone might have a thought or answer to the question  oh one other thing of note: apparently an early name in the original star wars for the jedi was the jedi-bendu  take from that what you will,could the bendu be some type of incarnation/reincarnation of the father from mortis

1262,starwars,so my friends and i are doing this whole mandalorian group sorta like just an imaginative rpg where we make our own character concepts and my character has a stolen tie defender as his personal ship but then i realized something: my friends plan on having our home be a light freighter and while normally ties can dock with ships via these clamps the defender’s top wing prevents that and understandably because it doesn’t quite need to dock with its hyperdrivesome ideas where like a special docking thing where a part of the ship would be shaped so that the wing could fit in like a tetris block but i’m wondering if i would need to crawl to get into the ship like that,can a tie defender dock with a light freighter

1279,starwars,many years before the star wars movies were shown regularly on cable tv i could have sworn i saw a broadcast tv edit that  the close-ups of owen and berus charred corpses from the burning homestead scene and replaced them with alternate angles  today i found cbs valentines day 1987 airing of the film on an archive site and it contained the scene fully intact  am i imagining things or have there been alternate edited-for-tv versions over the years as the rights passed between networks,anh broadcast tv edit question: lars homestead
1280,starwars,hi everyone i just found out about this and was shocked there wasnt an article on it here pablo hidalgo a man from lucasfilm literally made fun of a youtuber who cried at the luke skywalker scene from s2e8 of the mandalorian just because he cried honestly i usually dont watch reaction vids but this was special you can see what happened in detail on the link in comments but can we start a petition to make mr hidalgo face consequences,pablo hidalgo and star wars theory
1281,starwars,im sure this question has been asked a millions times and will be asked a million more i know the most popular order is release order but where would the animated clone wars shows and also star wars rebels fall in place with those its a bit ambitious but i really want to watch all of it from beginning to current end im just not sure which way would give the best experience,what order to i watch the franchise in

1284,starwars,for context this all takes place in legends continuityi find it a bit strange that the republic and the jedi despite having multiple battles on the planet never sensed or realized that the planet’s natives were force-sensitive going by the force unleashed at least one of the battles took place in their territoryi mean surely the jedi would be very interested in a planet-wide race of sentient beings that were all moderately strong in the force,did the jedi order not know about jungle felucians being force-sensitive

1299,starwars,i just can’t take it anymore can we just stop all this seemingly unending hatred takes so much enjoyment out of this fandomi love all the star wars movies and books games toys etc but it feels like it’s impossible to enjoy the franchise anymore every time i log onto a star wars themed subreddit the very first thing i see is how dumb half the fandom is i used to love interacting with this fandom i’ve earned upvotes from seemingly every subreddit: /r/starwars /r/prequelmemes /r/sequelmemes /r/themandaloriantv /r/galaxysedge and even /r/saltierthancrait and /r/saltierthankrayt yes bothbut reddit isn’t a place for sharing praise and criticism now what happened to the star wars fandom whereas we once discussed a shared love for the series today it seems like fandom is just a constant competition among the fans to show who can hate certain movies most vocally rock bottom was when i’ve seen the mental health of sequels fans get attacked by other fanscan we just try to like what each other likes not just keep ourselves to our subreddits in echo-chambers but try to share each other’s likings can’t the ot diehards start to enjoy prequel lorecan’t the prequel memers try to enjoy the acting of the sequel actors and actressescan’t we all just enjoy the mandalorian without attacking each othermaybe i’m being too wishful but the message i got from star wars movies is that being hateful is ultimately self-destructive,i’m so exhausted by this fandom the endless sequel trilogy arguments are draining me

1304,starwars,in the clone wars i believe season 1 where ahsoka is chasing the fugitive there is a billboard hologram of palpatine telling the citizens to stop blaming the jedi for the war i thought that was pretty cool it goes past the narrative that the jedi were labeled traitors after order 66 but the distrust was being setup long before the war ended they were being blamed for starting and continuing the war the problems with keeping peace in areas not affected by the war and throughout the show about people always saying this is why nobody trusts the jedi order,am i the only one that noticed this in the clone wats

1318,starwars,because when you read the books they’re really long and when you watch the movie it’s only like 2 hours and i assume that the contents from the book are the same as the moviewhat do the star wars community think,i’ve always been curious: is it even worth reading the books of the star wars movies or not
1319,starwars,will the bad batch show be a 1 season show or will it be a series with multiple seasonsbecause from looking over the entire star wars universe the bad batch seem a lot smaller in the events compared to the other characters in the star wars universe,i have a question regarding the bad batch show
1320,starwars,i’m confused about the clone troopers i understand that in the clone wars the sith controlled robots and the republic the good guys i think controlled the clone troopers now i have a question who controlled the sith and republic during the war  then from my understanding after the war some time later there was another war with the republic being bad now is this correct,please help me understand the main factions
1321,starwars,,would you rather them make a movie or a tv show series based off your favorite character
1322,starwars,hey just getting into star wars so far really enjoying it i decided to watch in order so started with episode 1 just had a few questions i thought some of you might be able to answer mostly about episode 4 so far1 obi wan tells luke that his father didnt share the same ideals as his uncle who wanted him to stay on tatooine is this just one of the mistakes that happen when you make prequels 20 years after your original trilogy2 obi wan talks about vader hunting down the jedi which i guess sort of works in terms of revenge of the sith but also heavily implies that vader is a separate person from anakin i understand there is supposed to be a distinction between the two good version vs bad but again is this just something george lucas wasnt thinking about/didnt know during the original trilogyill definitely be asking a lot more questions as i get through but so far this is whats confusing me,new fan questions
1323,starwars,so to begin with i just watched the movies and loved them so now i want to read the comics where would you begin i have no idea and there are so many are there any that relate to the mandalorian,comics
1324,starwars,chest piece on scout guardim looking to make a chest piece that lights up identical to this one im trying to find other instances in the star wars universe of a chest piece that lights up like the one shown on the scout guard season 2 ep 5 mandalorian looks like it may be their rank then a red + white square lit up on the right side of the control panel if anyone can help provide any examples youve seen of this thanks in advance,can anyone id this chest piece mandalorian spoilers

1335,starwars,,i got my hands on the new thrawn trilogy
1336,starwars,im not commenting on if they *should* do that i love the comic just wondering if anyone thinks they *would*,vader finding out that he has a son is a huge moment as of now that moment happens in the comic books do you think there is any chance they decide to retcon that moment so it can take place in live action during the kenobi disney+ series
1337,starwars,wouldn’t it be amazing to have a force sensitive acklay whose abilities have it sapience perhaps it can be a focal point of a legend told by yoda or even luke and could serve as a lesson to not make assumptions about a entire species of creatures,acklay jedi
1338,starwars,since its confirmed vader will be in the obi-wan series its been speculated that obi-wan will try to convert him back to the light again because of vaders line in rotj obi-wan once thought as you didsource: i hope during their encounter vader/anakin learns that he didnt *technically or actually* kill padme im sure others might not agree because they want vader to continue to hate himself for everything amongst other reasons but idk me personally i always thought it was tragic that he died believing he killed his wifemaybe they could use this to make his hate for the emperor stronger since he lied to him about that also and a zillion other ideas could be made too of coursei have spoken,i hope anakin learns in the new obi-wan series that he didnt actually kill padme
1339,starwars,,made this in sfm today hope you like it
1340,starwars,,do we have any idea what happens in this scene padme clearly knows whats going on with anakin and they seem to be having some kind of a back-and-forth through the force upsetting both of them its exactly at half runtime in rots and probably the most important scene in sw and i totally forgot it

1344,starwars,,do we have any idea what happens in this scene padme clearly knows whats going on with anakin and they seem to be having some kind of a back-and-forth through the force upsetting both of them its exactly at half runtime in rots and probably the most important scene in sw and i totally forgot it

1358,starwars,view poll,whats your favorite star wars movie
1359,starwars,view poll,which is your favorite star wars movie
1360,starwars,for starters jedi kinda suck lol they are told to suppress their feelings in order to survive in the world they are suppose to be peacekeepers  but in the prequels they are basically soldiers  they basically take kids out of their homes to train themprequels are insane because literally both sides are the dark side there is literally no way to win especially with order 99 they get absolutely  demolished then on top of that you have anakin become vader an even harsher even creation in the star wars galaxy good side gets absolutely  wrecked the good side gets wrecked  nearly all the time  luke had his win when he defeated vader  but that place didnt last long  at all he made a training temple that got  urged to the groundi feel like twicerey might be the true savor with defeating palpatine for good its kinda seems the balance in this galaxy leans more dark idki would love to see a short film a few years later summarizing whats happened with rey and companyi love star wars just shooting thoughts out,star wars is an epic space tragedy
1361,starwars,to be honest i feel like i’ve noticed that star wars fans have been pretty much been divided this big division started with jj’s star wars and disney creating their own canon and labeling all the other stuff that we know about our loved characters as extended universe with this in mind that luke that we saw in the new star wars was not the luke i grew up with from the books the comics and everything else because disney has decided to say that is the extended universe my idea is to say well i don’t care disney your shit sucked the extended universe is the real universe and that is canon so in my mind 7  8 and nine never happened they are in a different universe and i’m taking everything else back you can see disney is trying to fix this in the mandalorian show they are using non-canon stuff which is from the extended universe  placing it in their show and now making it canon disney just needs to come out and say look we fucked splitting the universes and now we’re gonna say everything except for 7 8 and 9 is canon,you can keep your universe disney

1366,starwars,,best practitioners of each form towards the end of the clone wars
1367,starwars,i forget the name of the movie but the 2nd one of the new star wars is the best or the most interesting from a twists and turns defying convention point of view the amount of things that can be analyzed is intense for example in the final fight scene one of the red guys is about to stab the main character and in the next frame the knife suddenly just vanishes them choosing not the do a re shoot of this scene leads me to believe that maybe this is one of rays new force powers and instead of holding the audiences hand in terms of explaining things they just let it happen and leave it open to interpretation i have seen hema people claim the choreography is bad but i think they miss the point of the movie they even show the luke to be a weak coward which subverts expectations so heavily from the originals that  i never saw it coming one word zany another crazy unusual choice was the slow motion version of a chase scene the ships following one another was like watching a car chase but slowed down and turned into the main plot not something i expected for one you think of well they can just launch some smaller faster ships or use long ranged weapons but then they dont and pay the price when the girl from blue velvet who is now purple turns into pure energy and becomes even more powerful than the jedi and sith combined then you think that the luke will have this awesome showdown but theres a twist and he is actually a ghost before he even dies and then after that he dies then there is a part where the director took some strong influences from marry poppins and has layer the main character fly through space using the force to survive which feels like it belongs in a different movie scenes like this can be hilarious but i found a lot of the humor to be a lot less slapstick and more plot based for example how they humorously mock the genre by pretending theres things like gravity in space massive departure from the play it safe first episode i left the movie feeling like the same people did not even make the first and second movies which i know would be insane while i would say i enjoyed it i will probably not watch the next movie because i am happy with where the story ended overall feel pretty satisfied with the villain defeated and the conclusion to rays story my only mark against it though is i think younger audiences will have trouble with a lot of what exactly makes it so funny and good i would like to know where the knife that was about to stab layer during the red room fight scene went though maybe this will be explained in the persondolorian series,been obsessed with episode two and it is now my favorite star wars

1375,starwars,the jedi purge was partly to rid the galaxy of jedi as they were the only real threat to sidious and his empire at the time it went as far as sending anakin and ordering clones to kill younglings to prevent them from growing up to become jedi my question is if there were any other siths at this time do you think they would be order 66 and purge targets aswellsince jedi were the only threat to palpatine wouldnt other sith be aswell after all sith arent above killing other sith as everyone knows especially to gain power in fact while the inquisitor program was formed in order to hunt down jedi survivors of order 66 while inquisitors were force users vader and sidious made sure not to give them any training in ways of the sith for fear that the inquistors would become too powerful and might even attempted to overthrow them bothso with this knowledge do you think other siths would also be a target during the great purge,do you think sith wouldve been killed during the great purge just like jedi were

1378,starwars,i personally hate the sequels i think disney destroyed star wars reputation for having good movies let me remind you that the mandalorian was a show and disney is somehow cooking up new shows which im hyped for but the movies are trashier than a landfill the only good disney star wars film was rogue onenow i personally hate kathleen kennedy for ruining star wars she thought rogue one was boring thats an example of being stupid and not having good taste the mandalorian was also the only good sequel keep in mind im a prequel fan and i 100% agree with someone if they say the sequels were trash&amp;#x200b;anyway i want to rant more but im just going to end it here,sequel rant
1379,starwars,i‘m not saying i know anything about physics and what time exactly is and such things but wouldn’t different planets also have different time zones and years like i imagine some planets are circling around slowler than others and others are faster wouldn’t that create a big confusion for everyone what time and year it is for everyone i know star wars is just a space opera but when you think more about this it creates some plot holes and such is it explained somewhere in legends or canon how this stuff works or should we just suspend our disbelief haha,how does time flow in the star wars universe
1380,starwars,i just finished the second season of the mandalorian while the show was a lot of fun and the introductions of old characters were awesome all of the fights just seem so boring and cheesy to me i know it’s star wars i know this isn’t some grade a action movie with the highest trained military in film history but can we do a little bit betterwatching the ot it was laughable how bad the storm troopers aim was it’s fun to look back on it because it’s an older movie and with older movies comes things such as that but aren’t we at the point where things can get a little more interesting i’m so sick of seeing every single bullet miss the heroes i’m sick of these troopers just stumbling along not using any type of formation or tactics whatsoever you have a galactic empire that can rule the galaxy but can’t devote a little time to military tacticsmandalorian spoiler ahead: i knew luke was going to show up in this final episode and i was really excited to see him slaughter through these black droids you know these droids who seemed unstoppable and a single one almost took down the undefeated mando yet when luke faced them not only did he slaughter them he pretty much did it in slow motion it’s just so cheesy and lame i know a lot of people don’t like the prequels but this is what i miss most about them i miss that field of jedis surrounded by thousands of droids swiping away shot after shot in a matter of seconds at that point it at least seemed like they were ridiculously skilled and not that the enemies were just damn moronsi know star wars is a casual viewing experience when it comes to this aspect i’m discussing i just wish it could improve doing so in this series would have put a nice touch on it,are we ever going to get smart skilled enemy soldiers in a star wars movie/series
1381,starwars,,guys so i did this thing where i gave someone $20 when they say general kenobi after i say hello there 😅 i just thought its christmas&amp;new years period so it would be nice to give away something i would love if you guys checked it out :
1382,starwars,the fanbase hasnt been this united since the original films both the prequels and sequels caused a lot of division yet those who disliked the prequels and sequels both seem to love mando and those who like the films also love mando,has mandalorian saved the star wars fandom
1383,starwars,i know a lot of people thought/wanted snoke was going to be plagueis or some other ancient sith however i think that him being unimportant to the overall narrative of the sequels is actually really smart i think if you had snoke be an ancient sith it would bring too many negatives than positives both within the narrative and the random narratively i think kylo completing his training is something that had to be done and is something that made him grown as a dark side user the act of the apprentice killing the master is essential in the rule of 2 i think if you had snoke be plagueis it would have made a lot of the community mad that the new characters beat such a strong opponent who was able to go under the radar of sidious and vader going and moving on to what i just appreciate about the use of snoke in tlj is his design he is literally dressed and robed in gold his own negligence and own ego in a way was his downfall underestimating his apprentice fuck y’all snoke is dope,snoke was better as an unknown character

1395,starwars,,ts and ps to tom kane huge contributor to the star wars galaxy
1396,starwars,some of my favourite parts of the st were the flashbacks of post rtoj i think there couldve been a cool trilogy there that could still be made lukes quest to setup a new jedi academy hunting sith artefacts and training leia the rise of the new republic the sith worshippers quest to kill palpatines children and bring him back to life and most importantly the corruption of ben solo his ascension to the knights of ren and as snokes apprentice whenever i rewatch the st these events always stick in my mind because i think that we couldve and still can get great story from them in cinema although carrie fishers passing and harrison fords departure may make this fruitless plus i feel that the amount of new ot and post ot era content we are getting is going to leave the more casual viewers fatigued a boy can only dream i guess:,does anyone else think that the st shouldve been the flashbacks they showed
1397,starwars,,took my dog for a walk today
1398,starwars,i’ve been forced to re-watch the sequel trilogy with my family and just finished the last jedi and i have a few problems with its while chase dynamic throughout the entire movie i couldn’t help but wonder why the first order doesn’t just deploy all of their fighters both at the very beginning or after the resistance jumps away the first time or why they didn’t  bring any support ships with them when they went to chase down the resistance or engage them in the fist place instead opting to bring in some sort of battle cruiser though it’s called a dreadnought and i’m not sure why i thought those were smaller anti fighter corvette type things completely unsupported with no smaller ships to support it and then immediately after losing your main capital ship due to a lack of support bring in an even bigger ssd with your supreme leader on it and still no support of any kind other then a few star destroyers witch have abysmal anti fighter capabilities then they just sit there and throw shots at the resistance hoping to eventually break the shields on mon cala ships no less my other issue lies with the other faction the great resistance who just sit there and wait to die though there isn’t any other option really decide to elect to command admiral holdo who is a terrible leader spreading false hope and refusing to share her plan with anyone leading to a mutiny costing the resistance even more people and equipment on a similar note about the resistance why do they use those huge slow and clunky bombers instead of the tried and true b-wings and y-wings which are much faster and arguably better tl;dr the resistance and the first order have no idea of how naval combat worksif this sounds incoherent then lmk i’m pretty tired writing this,does anyone know why the first order and the resistance are so dumb

1456,starwars,,the mandalorian why redacted is making major celebrities nervous
1457,starwars,i would genuinely like to know in depth and with reason why as a fan you enjoy these movies personally i think they are not only cinematic failures  but just straight trash can star wars films or storytelling if you willmy list is long  but to be succinct for discussions sakes my biggest problems are:shitty character development honestly don’t give 2 shits about any of the newer characters rey and ben have potential but are executed poorly they insulted the legacy of previous characters we all lovedwhat they did to luke is unforgivable and not anything i believe we’d expect from lukebringing back palptine especially with no damn good explanation was just lamethe plot holes the obvious lack of story consistency or a outline for how it should goside characters were terrible no it has nothing to do with kelly marie tran being an asian woman or any of that shit personally i love all the actors she seems sweet as hell daisy is a gem domhall and oscar isaac are great actors adam driver is awesome i literally have no issue with the actors their characters however are weak and poorly written i could easily keep going but i want to hear why i’m wrong or looking at it wrong thanks,question for fans who love tlj and tros
1458,starwars,,a picture of the casting 1977
1459,starwars,,light of the jedi - did i get this early release date was jan 5th 2021
1460,starwars,he was of course involved with the final scene of the mandalorian but from what ive seen hes pretty solid on the general lore as well if they do continue the luke storyline the combination of him/favreau/filoni/lucas would be pretty godlike,hamill continuing as a consultant for star wars
1461,starwars,,twisted tea wars
1462,starwars,ok so probably bonkers theory but as we saw in the finale of mando s2 din gives grogu off to luke to be properly trained in the ways of the forceso thematically as mando gave luke his “son” for safekeeping i wonder if maybe mando s4 or some future finale episode see’s an older luke maybe 15 aby giving his child to mando to keep safe from the growing threat he feels on the horizon ben/stoke/sideousyes i know there’s no mention of any child in the st but let’s be honest the backstories of anything before tfa were brief glossed over and contradictory at besti could totally see filoni and faverau doing mara jade at some point and also bringing in some version of ben skywalker from legends anakin skywalker ii in this version so in my wild bonkers theory we see this future point at the end of the mando story when din is older and thinks his adventures are maybe over when he’s contacted by luke meeting him in secret luke says something like “*as you once entrusted me with your precious child i must now ask you to do the same for me keep him safe keep him from harm and above keep him away from the dark side”*the scene then ends in a parallel to s2 finale with old man mando with grogu by his side and a young child asleep in his armsthis is basically because i think it would thematically be a nice touch but also i really wanted the skywalker line to continue through luke like in legends and this seems the only plausible way to do it to line up with the stthoughts,possible future mandalorian plot idea theory spoilers mando s2 finale
1463,starwars,i cant find any good videos that show the slave i shooting from its front lasers the ones on the opposite side as the cockpit bottom of ship while in flight i am trying to figure out if the lasers move together or if each one can move without the other anyone know or have a link to a video showing one or the other or both,did the slave 1 lasers move independently or together

1471,starwars,,my girlfriend got me these for christmas i finished all 6 issues of thrawn and am halfway through the ahsoka novel
1472,starwars,despite everything i think is wrong with the new trilogy there is one point that stuck in my crawl from the beginning the empire is maybe one generation from being destroyed no one comes to help the people that stopped the empire part time and one if them was the effing leader of the new republic its like if people not only forgot wwi happened and were surprised by wwii but they refused to admit germany was ever a country so that couldnt have happened it took all i had to not use any caps where they arent supposed to be,biggest problem with the new trilogy

1475,starwars,buckle up this is going to be a long one i’ve decided that i’m going to design myself a star wars tarot deck for now i’m only going to be making the major arcana but i thought i’d share my ideas for who/what i’m thinking about representing each card and get some feedback about my choices : i’ve decided to base my choices on the meanings behind the card rather than just going off the name i also haven’t decided if i’m going to change the names of the cards or just stick with the traditional names so 1 the magician = ahsoka - sudden solution surpassing the plausible 2 high priestess = rey - secrets and hidden circumstances 3 the empress = leia organa - gentle power rarely opposed 4 the emperor = kylo ren - yield or suffer up against real power 5 the hierophant = qui gon jin - spiritual authority approval from elevated dignity 6 the lovers = anakin and padme - intense affection 7 the chariot = millennium falcon - triumph success in spite of resistance 8 strength = luke skywalker - superior a great feat hero 9 the hermit = yoda - lesson/reward solitude isolation 10 wheel of fortune = han solo - uncertain outcome unpredictable 11 justice = mace windu - rule of law justice12 the hanged man = obi-wan kenobi - great personal sacrifice sacrifice 13 death = darth vader - costly loss coming to an end 14 temperance = r2d2 - moderation passing of time patience 15 the devil = palpatine/sideous - giving into temptation nemesis 16 the tower = the jedi temple - spectacular ambition ending in disaster destruction failure 17 the star = the father - pause and reflect distance unreachable 18 the moon = the daughter - longing hope of fulfilment 19 the sun = the son - ability triumph great resources 20 judgement = force ghosts ben kenobi yoda &amp; anakin - ultimate judgement result final outcome 21 the world = the world between worlds - success but not for free opportunity 22 the fool = c3po - blissful carelessness ignorance innocence,star wars tarot cards

1478,starwars,i think it’s possible and maybe even likely that yoda’s species growth has some connection with how in tune to the force they are grogu looks like a little baby and he’s 50 i’m pretty sure yoda became a jedi master around 100 either most of their growing happens in that second 50 year chunk of their life or it’s influenced by something else maybe grogu was bigger at one point and regressed physically like his force powers did i just feel like based on how he looks now that he would have been too little to even train before order 66 if he follows normal growth rules,yoda species theory

1509,starwars,okay so i’m generally new to star wars i got into the movies when i finished the second season of mando i watched the new hope trilogy and then restarted bc i wanted to watch in chronological order so the first appearance of a force ghost i seen was obi wans they made it seem like force ghost were just regular ghosts that you could see and hear but they couldn’t interfere with anything in the mortal world right but in rise of skywalker luke he is now a force ghost grabs his lightsaber that rey tries to chuck into kylos ship fire and right after that force lifts his ship out of water so my main question here is if force ghosts can grab things especially sabers and still use the force when they are ghosts why arent all the dead jedi kicking empire ass,i need answers force ghosts

1514,starwars,what are your thoughts on mace windu taking up that role do you guys think this would be milking the characters too muchim a kenobi fan and have read a good amount of books in the eu i enjoyed the  asharad hett/darth krayt spinoff it makes sense a jedi who survives order 66 goes home he has a hatred for anakin and wants to kill anakins son and turns to the dark side however i think disney has done away with the eu and wouldnt fall specifically on that storyline here are some reasons why i think an epic battle between windu and kenobi could work: \-there are a handful of people in the galaxy who can challenge kenobi and windu is one of them to me it seems even more uncreative to whip out a superpowerful being out of thin air at best kenobi is top 5 in the galaxy yoda windu anakin palpatine vader at worst he was a master on the jedi council either way kenobi is definitely a top gun in the galaxy\-windu doesnt have to be an official darth windu can be a jedi who turned dark and is therefore a sith\-depending on how they do it i would be okay with survival darth maul was able to survive getting cut in half with his hate for kenobi palpatine was able to survive being blown up in the death star windu was a master of form 7/vaapad so i could see one unexpected betrayal could have tilted him to hatred and keep him alive \-maul turned out to be a reasonable character in clone wars and i want to see more of windu so i wouldnt be too upset if he avoided death maul was fueled by hatred/revenge so windu could be too windu was more powerful than maul and a top force user so he could have survived the force lightning yoda got up and fought after a weaker shock  terminal velocity/drop trauma would be blocked by the force\-dooku was a top jedi master who turned dark so i dont think it would be unreasonable for windu to also especially after being betrayed\-this sort of plot would allow him to stay low out of the eyes of the empire or maybe kenobi somehow lays an elaborate trap and its a windu vs vader finale vader will be in jedi hunting mode around this time anyways\-in the mandolorian it is a regular person in armor so ordinary obstacles are okay but in kenobi the villain has to be very powerful extra details:\- a tv show probably wont get into the weeds of lightsaber styles etc but on a more detailed side obi-wans style 3 could be a great defense against windus shatter point/vaapad greviouss attack style was a sort of vaapad in its own way where it could find all the holes in the enemies idk if it is canon but grevious killed a jedi master in 1v1 in 20 seconds  \- if there is no attack/anger to redirect windu would have to approach it differently than vaapad given he is a master of all the styles its not a big deal in theory if there are no weaknesses then shatter point wont help in the rots book windu says but surely master windu obi-wan had said you with the power of vaapad-or yodas mastery of ataru- mace windu had almost smiled **i created vaapad to answer my weakness: it channels my own darkness into a weapon of the light master yodas ataru is also an answer to weakness: the limitations of reach and mobility imposed by his stature and his age but for you what weakness does soresu answer** blinking obi-wan had been forced to admit hed never actually thought of it that way that is so like you master kenobi the korun master had said shaking his head i am called a great swordsman because i invented a lethal style; but who is greater the creator of a killing form or the master of the classic form - rots book\-for people who think windu would stomp kenobi maybe kenoni has mastered his connection with the krayt dragon and will just tell it to eat windups: i just realized darth krayt is named after the krayt dragon&amp;#x200b;sorry if the thoughts are all over the place i wanted to see what you guys thought,thoughts on mace windu appearing in kenobi in an asharad hett style spinoff

1529,starwars,if durge had a darksaber he would not have had a hard time against grievous and all the other jedidurge knows many ways to kill mandalorians and the darksaber has to be the key to push them to the cliff before they face mass extinctioneven as a pretender to the throne can mandalorians be put under fear to the point durge would swiftly execute them in a slight breezemaybe the mandalorians can change their minds after all of this and accept the new ways that din jango and boba went throughafter all durge would put all mandalorians and pseudo mandalorians unite together to defeat a common threat in order to dethrone him to pave way towards a new era i bet s3 will feature the imperials as a lesser threat as if they were to hire durge he will pretty much steal the show since his ties to his hatred for the mandalorians makes it a focal point overshadowing the imperialsor if durge doesnt make it an expy can taking all of his traits and project durge making it the durge of disneyversethoughts,how effective if durge were to wield the darksaber in combat and if he won it in a battle from din imagine how terrifying mandalorians would be if he were to exploit it just to slaughter then all heck he would even keep as part of his spoils of war as a trophy

1540,starwars,,my personal tier listdont bother with death threats unless you want to make me laugh
1541,starwars,alright so i watched the originals and the prequels when i was so young i did not truly understand what was going on in these movies now ive decided to watch the movies again and there have been a few questions i have been asking myself that come from all the star wars talks ive read over the years so here goes btw if these questions have already been answered i am sorry and feel free to remove my thread ill get my answers some other way1 why do the prequels get so much hate i know people talked a lot about the conversations anakin has with padme as being bad or stuff but what i see is a 19 years old boy who was originally very close to his emotions in episode 1 with his mother he was always a very empathic and loving child who then got told to repress his emotions the become a jedi by being trained by obi-wan who was actually training him because of his emotions for his late master from what i have been seeing obi-wan is terrible at controlling his emotions as soon as anakin or his master is involved he also keeps talking about how he hates things also anakin shows a very high respect for senator palpatine who keeps telling him that he will become stronger by embracing his emotions these emotions are clearly shown when he meets padme again and for a kid who never had any dating advice or experience it makes sense that he looks like a real fool speaking to the love of his life 2 i might be wrong here but arent the jedi masters a bit hypocritical and is maybe one of the things that were supposed to be understood but i just now understand luke was a very emotional person but had a clear mind and could stay calm in moments he needed which helped him control his powers but his emotions actually made his powers much stronger yoda is another with whom i noticed this in ep5 when he is training luke he keeps arguing with obi-wan and keeps dodging lukes questions which makes me feel like he is experiencing sadness/fear but tries to repress it infront of luke but the fact that he does have those emotions and lives them makes me think that is why he is such a powerful jedi this would mean that they are purposefully training sub-par jedis because of their fear of having people get angry and realize how powerful those emotions are but if they could use their love and empathy instead they could be far more stronger all while staying attuned to the light side3 why were people upset about the message heard from emporia palpatine in the new episodes being something that happened in fortnite and not any official sources the beginning introductions in all the movies seemed to talk about bits that did not make it in the official star wars media so why was that one such a controversy4 is there any easy to access shows/books or anything else that goes more into side stories such as the mandalorian heard there was a yoda ark in the clone wars series is there anything else like thati have a few more but my lack of remembering character names makes it difficult for me to ask them and might make this thread too long of a read to get the answers i truly want thank you for reading and thanks to anyone who can suggest good material to get more out of my star wars re-experience,questions from a re-watcher

1552,starwars,here’s my personal pitch for a luke skywalker series on disney+the series begins shortly after the mandalorian season 2 luke has just begun training grogu as his apprentice although luke won’t start his jedi academy for another 6 years in 15 aby which allows this show to run for 5-6 seasons luke grogu and r2-d2 are traveling around the galaxy learning the history and culture of the jedi we see luke gather the 8 sacred jedi texts seen in the sequel trilogy and learn more about what’s in them we can even show the first meeting between luke and lor san tekka hell maybe even bring in ashoka for an episode luke is being guided on this long journey by anakin’s and yoda’s force ghost i’d love to see a meeting between yoda and grogu the first antagonist of the series would be mara jade  let me explain in this timeline mara jade would have been a secret apprentice to the emperor not even vader knew kinda like starkiller in a way she was trained to either avenge his and vader’s death or become a replacement for vader should he die although the emperor didn’t prefer her over luke she’s out for revenge against luke for supposedly killing the emperor and vader eventually she turns to the light side and becomes a jedi since this show would run for 5-6 seasons we would have plenty of time for this character development her and luke can get married or stay separated it’s complicated maybe they did get married but she died in the fire or maybe they stay separate let me hear your ideas on this subjectthe series would end with luke and maybe mara jade establishing a new jedi academy we can even feature a young ben solo a de-aged han and leia and chewbacca at the opening of the academy,my pitch for a luke series
1553,starwars,i’ve only seen it once but i’m just wondering about the trip to the casino planetif the two fleet’s are travelling at hyperspeed and they leave how can they catch back up to themi’m also not really wanting an argument about the merits or not of the film i’m just wanting to know if there’s an in universe explanation,question about last jedi

1562,starwars,,i love star warsbut our fandom be wildin
1563,starwars,,she didn’t know
1564,starwars,i love the title of rots and palpatines scheming and plotting best parts of the saga sometimes i thought “revenge for what” what could the jedi have done that was so bad that they would plot revenge for 1000 years then i read the darth bane books and some others that touch on the great jedi schism but now that they are no longer canon i kind of hope that in the high republic they actually show that the sith weren’t always evil what if instead they started out good and that the dark side wasn’t inherently evil then something happened that forced the jedi to commit an atrocity so horrible that it turned the sith into the dark lords we know today then it turns out that the jedi covered it up and yoda knew all along it could even be part of the reason that the jedi forbid attachments and teach against giving into emotions i wonder if they could even change the prophecy of the chosen one so that balance didn’t mean destroying the sith but redeeming them somehow like bringing them back to the original sith teachings one more week until the new high republic books come out and i can’t wait to read what new stories they tell,i hope the high republic give a new reason for why order 66 revenge of the sith
1565,starwars,stupid question of the day can someone explain canon in  laymans terms  so all the movies and shows and all books after 2014  im confused cause i feel some books before 2014 deal directly with the movies  i also always see ppl saying about stuff falling out of canon  how does something go from canon to not canon and if it falls out of canon does that make it legends then,canon

1574,starwars,i was a huge fan of the eu and i have been frustrated with disney ever since the ditched my favorite characters/arcs in 2014 imho episodes vii-ix basically bootlegged cool plots from the old eu and then poorly executed them i read and collected books leading up to about 2010-11 at that time i had read close to 75% of the material set after episode vi and about 50% of the material set pre episode i i tried to get into a couple novels right after episode vii came out but i didnt care for them its been so long so idk what they were anymore however the mandalorian season 2 and the clone wars finale has whet my appetite for all things star wars and given me a new hope for the new canon but im not sure where to start since i have been out the loop so long what are the best novels in this new canon preferably set post episode iii or pre episode i but i will take any recommendations if the book is goodtimothy zahn everything thrawn kevin j anderson jedi academy trilogy troy denning killicks legacy of the force karen traviss legacy of the force aaron allston legacy of the force and michael a stackpole x-wing series were some of my favorite authors if they have anything good id be interested,recommended reading for the new canon

1607,starwars,so weve all heard this discussion a million times before but like my buddy m night said : but wait theres a twistid like to be open and honest with something first i think rey is a mary sue character and a lot of what was done in rise of skywalker was making up for a lot of lost time that they simply did not have but thats not the important thing here here is the twist : see i think star wars canon is robust enough for both rey and original older luke to coexist i think that diverging timelines should definitely be a thing but thats ultimately down to disney the galaxy is a big place it can host luke and ahsoka and rey in it if it wants as well as all of the nonbinary and transgendered characters necessary hey so yall realize palpatine was trying to lowkey become transgendered right like him going from old man to young lady was like   a thing  yerr what this galaxy can not host however   is empire like behavior masquerading as rebellion harassment is not coolcalling everything you dont like sjw  and going off on a rant about how they are ruining everything is not cool calling every female character a mary sue without seriously considering the reasons for it is not coolbeing an ass to people for sharing their emotions over a powerful moment that reminded them of their childhood hero that helped them survive cancer is not fucking cool not every piece of work regarding star wars is going to be for me and that is okay i dont have to like everything sw does and that is okayim allowed to like what parts of sw are acceptable and that is okay so yeah uhh   peace security and no fucking death star,i cant defend the sequel trilogy its just not good but thats okay

1617,starwars,hi allim a big fan of watching youtubers each week following the mandalorian episodesalongside this i check websites like ign comic book resources and screenrant for star wars write upts predictions theories etcim just wondering what are some of the best/main websites/twitter accounts to follow for news/rumours about upcoming star wars shows comics books etcthanks in advance,suggested news/rumours sites &amp; sources
1618,starwars,,i tried to styling the mandalorian skin in fortnite to match boba fetts armor
1619,starwars,i want to preface this by saying that this is just my opinion i tear up every time i watch it because of how magnificently executed it ismaybe its the events that lead up to it that already put me in such an emotional state anakin asking luke to remove his helmet so that he can see him with his own eyes anakin telling him to go luke wanting to save his father so badly he knew anakin had redeemed himself and that he was enslaved by the dark side and palpatine in many ways the funeral itself is beautiful sad and poetic all at the same time its extremely sad because only luke attends while the rest of the galaxy celebrates vaders death and the fall of the empire this all happens in spite of anakin redeeming himself luke viewed his father as a hero in his final moments and chose to honor and respect him for his bravery when it counted most the burning of vaders suit in a way signifies the end of story of vader/anakin it also is a great callback to what created vader physically  binary sunset playing in the background is simply perfection john williams makes everything better the lack of dialogue is extremely powerful what could luke have said what can one say after such an experience luke knew the truth and that was more than enough he laid anakin to rest knowing that he had fulfilled his destinyno matter how many times i view this scene it will always bring me to tears,vaders funeral is the best scene in all of star wars
1620,starwars,acting: 7/10effects: 65/10story: 7/10 overall 75/10 i likes this one more than a new hope bc this one had better pacing on to attack of the clonesnote: nice to see that yoda is back,my rating of the phantom menace as a first time viewer of the sw series

1624,starwars,doing a rewatch of the movies over the past couple of holiday weeks and finally made it to episode ii remember thinking the pod racing scene was interesting but maybe a tad bit too long for my taste but the sound design that the race has is absolutely incredibleeach pod has its own distinct sound the pods echo when entering caves and the destruction sounds when a pod crashes just give such a guttural feel to the entire thing and honestly the cgi from this scene holds up fairly well tooi see the seismic charges always referenced as a wonderful star wars sound which it is but i just feel the pod racing scene is a somewhat slept on scene in that regard,pod racing scene sound design

1635,starwars,small context that made me think of this question there are many different scenarios that would apply here im watching the clone wars series and mace windu is on ryloth discussing troop presence on the planet after hes left and freed ryloth from the separatists syndulla asks how long till i am fighting you he believes that the separatists and the republic are practically the same in the eyes of ryloth and their peoplewould syndulla and anyone in a similar position have thought that the jedi betrayed them and were always evil or would he have recognized what really happened how would this reputation translate throughout the generations bad omen or guardian angels,what was the reputation of the jedi after the empire was created specifically in the eyes of those that were given protection from the separatists
1636,starwars,star wars theory is a canadian star wars youtuber who created his channel back in 30th july 2016 and has since then made over 1800 videos registering 778 million viewson the 22nd december 2018 he published  vader episode 1: shards of the past - a star wars theory fan-film which has gained 22 million views and caused him to gain worldwide fame he regularly creates lore videos along with breakdowns of all the new star wars ie mandalorian and clone wars he also has a podcast rule of two where he and the collider owner marc fernandez discuss all things star wars occasionally bringing on guests including ashley eckstien and sam witwernow onto why i dislike him i will try to b e as objective as possible presenting only facts* clickbait - now there is nothing inherently wrong with clickbait as long as you stay honest; a line which he crosses his content consists a lot of theories but he titles the videos in a way that makes his theories seem like they are confirmed news **cal kestis saves grogu in the mandalorian season 2 - star wars theory** **anakin saved grogu during order 66 - star wars theory**  **mace windus return in the mandalorian season 2 - star wars theory** whilst the word theory is present in these titles that is so when you search his channel name these videos pop up nowhere is it said that the yare unofficial or fan made etc this is part of a larger problem on youtube of putting a channels name in your title to grab their viewers - he has 183 videos that do just that star wars theorys star wars explained playlist* canon - now a lot of modern day star wars on youtube revolves around the new canon anything released post 2014 through the lucasfilm licensing program he used to make videos where it was implied they were canon ie he used pictures of them from canon but talked about legends stuff but that has stopped now something he still does however during videos discussing things that are canon which he very clearly made sure we knew that it was canon he will commonly refer to a legends idea/concept as the crux of his argument for instance in a video about grogu he said that its yoda and yaddles son as in legends ki-adi mundi was able to breed in order to save his dying species this was showcased on multiple occasions in the star wars republic comic series that ran from 1998-2013 is some form or another* manipulation of viewers - this one cannot be supported by facts but merely context and observations when swt made his vader fanfilm it was claimed under grounds of copyright infringement by warner tamerlane publishing corp who license the music for star wars this was because he included a sample of imperial march in his product at the time the film was not monetised but that doesnt mean it wasnt copyright infringement he started a campaign asking disney to reverse their claim he said he just wanted them to remove the adds - something they could still do whilst the video was claimed after a public outcry and borderline harassment to disney but specifically certain employees kathleen kennedy and the usual suspects you know who i mean and the twitter operators in the end presumably to avoid more drama they reversed the claim and apologised since then it has been more of the same: playing victim urging people to fight his battles and by not discouraging and behaviour indirectly endorsing it and after getting what he wants defends himself again by saying he didnt want thus as these keeps on happening it is hard to believe that he doesnt wish this as there are many things he could do stop this from becoming harassment and cyberbullying there are many other examples of him clearly tricking his viewers that i could bring up but that is not what i am here for**pablo hidalgo controversy** the grounds for this recent pablo hidalgo controversy is one tweet out of context that cannot be viewed due to his account being private giving swt the benefit of the doubt that he didnt realise it could actually mean anything after having been criticised by many people lfl and ea employees along with news journalists all who pointed this out youd think he would at least acknowledge his possible lapse in judgement which he hasnt today he published another video on this issue where he marc fernandez and denofnerds have brought it up again stirred on more of the hate on proving he will not back down why would he do this well controversy benefits the accuser most of the time no matter the argument and its validity take tatty who accused james charles of being a sexual predator claims which were all rebuked with strong evidence: she gained 5 million subscribers through this whilst james lost 3 million this shows a motive to do what he is doing one that isnt purely protecting his reputation **verdict**theory is someone who i used to respect but since his breakthrough has fallen down a dark path so to speak i am not evaluating him as a human being but rather the content he puts out and the way he presents it he has shown signs of exploitation of channels established reputation and fans along with seemingly intentionally causing headline seeking drama and controversy,why star wars theory deserves the criticism he is getting

1688,starwars,i have been thinking about this for a while  i would really like jon favreau and dave filoni to make a new trilogy or series about the mandalorien wars and i actually think there are few hints in the mandalorian that would make this seem possible though i know that there are some problemsthe mandalorian brought back a bit of the eu into star wars mandalore the great was mentioned and the mandalorian wars i think dave and jon are trying to set something up by bringing this up in the series  plus in my personal opinion the potential is great and it would set a new tone for star wars in generalwhat i mean is that star wars was always in every movie and series somewhat connected to the skywalker family everything was taking place in these years but the kreative potential of the skywalker family is mearly exhausted cause of the sequals therefore i think to keep star wars going we need to break out of the skywalker franchise thats what is beginning with all these new series announced but there will be new movies in the future and i dont think it is a good idea to go on with rey her story is not what you would call a classic open ending eventhough it is possible that there will be something about her in the future i think it is not so important or imminent right now to continue her storythe biggest problem for a triliogy about something else than skywalker is that the fanbase in star wars is pretty split in the nerds i would consider myself as one and casuals the casuals are important for the prosperity of the movies and i think that for many casuals star wars is skywalker and thats why its hard to make new movies not connected to skywalker in the first placethough i think that the skywalker franchise doesnt give much more for new movies and i think dave and jon think that too and therefore they are trying to set a new tone for star wars fans and to sensitize them for something new not directly connected to the skywalker franchise with the mandalorianit is possible that in the future we may see star wars in movies or series that is not directly connected to the skywalker sagai am pretty interested in what is ahead of us for the the star wars universe  i am just sharing my opinion and i am interested in what you have to say about itps: i am not a native speaker so pls forgive me my awful grammar :,thoughts on the future of star wars television

1717,starwars,,will you
1718,starwars,,linework is donewill post the fully rendered drawing after its completed
1719,starwars,so the mandolorian takes place after rotj right and in rotj yoda told luke that when he died luke would be the last of the jedi but then asohka was in the mandolorian meaning that luke wasnt the last of the jedi and if she was alive in the sequels that means that the title the last jedi was a lie because asohka was still alive,im so confused rn
1720,starwars,hello there i have question could one force user make another force user use force like could have vader make luke force choke obi wan or something like that and is there an example in comics or books,question about the force
1721,starwars,,suffering from success
1722,starwars,generally speaking regardless of what people think about the movie *rogue one* overall most people seem to agree that the darth vader hallway scene was amazing save for a loud minority&amp;#x200b;usually this wouldnt bother me because there will always be a loud minority but combining the facts that one of the members of this loud minority is none other than comic book reviewer on youtube linkara aka lewis lovhaug and that the loud minority seems to always miss the point of the scene i feel like speaking up about it&amp;#x200b;whenever these haters criticise the scene they strawman people who love it as people who just think it looks cool and is a badass display of vaders powers and that therefor there is no point to it because we have already seen vader display his powers and we dont need to see more except thats not supposed to be the appeal to the scene thats not even the intention the director had with the scene if you ask him about it im sure some people out there are dumb enough to just think of the scene like that im looking at you doug walker aka nostalgia critic but i can only speak for myself and the intent of the scene  the thing is the whole point of the scene is that its supposed to feel like a horror movie its supposed to be terrifying we have never seen how ordinary people in the star wars universe views darth vader when he appears not quite like this at least because at this point siths and jedis are seen as mythological figures most people have never seen a sith or jedi at this point let alone darth vader so when they are stuck in this dark hallway and this very dark figure appears with a red lightsaber they freak out and panic  to them vader must appear like death personified to them what impacted me the most with this scene is how these experienced soldiers who are in life-threatening situations all the time suddenly lose all their rational thoughts and just panic to the point of one of them slamming hard against the closed door desperately shouting: **help us**regularly hed probably say something like: **we cant get out and are in danger we are in need of assistance**but no not this time as far as he is concerned a demonic being of unknown mysterious powers is in there with them to ruthlessly kill them without saying a word and he is terrified beyond rational reason&amp;#x200b;another thing haters like to point out is that either vader wouldnt do this or he could have just easily grabbed the chip if he wanted it so easily except vader obviously would be sent out himself to protect the plans to the death star as for the other point both *rogue one* and *a new hope* make it very clear that vader doesnt really give a crap about the death star and is just onboard with it out of respect for the emperor and tarkin not to mention vader is in constant pain to be more of a ruthless killing machine and this is his way of releasing that anger because he of course is still mad at the rebels for doing this and he just wants an excuse to go berserk&amp;#x200b;now its still fine if people dont like the darth vader hallway scene in *rogue one* for whatever reason but it feels like people like linkara do not understand why its a great scene and he is strawmanning people who love it for just being mindless idiots just wanting to see vader kick ass im more than sure some fans are like that - but im not one of them and i love and admire this darth vader scene for its intended purpose,defending the darth vader hallway scene in rogue one from haters

1726,starwars,,si
1727,starwars,i realise this is complete speculation and will likely not be realised until disney is truly out of ideas but considering theres speed of light travel and high tech space ships in the star wars universe surely its possible to travel from their galaxy to ours what era do you think a long time ago would be it would be funny to see star wars characters interacting with historical places or characters maybe nothing mainline but i could see it as a kids show: a cast of standard star wars characters like the group on rebels or something travelling to our galaxy do any of you think thats something youd watch,a galaxy far far away
1728,starwars,,look left side pls explain
1729,starwars,i thought of putting it before a new hope because it shows the power of darth vader and explains a large plot detail but its really different from any star wars movie because it has no lightsaber duels doesnt explain the force but mentions it so where should i put it,im watching in machete order with my little brother where should i put rogue one

1734,starwars,star wars capital/large ship types personal fanon:* **light freighter** \- anything from a heavy shuttle to a pirate corsair examples: *the millennium falcon* *rogue one* and *the mouldy crow*; c66 *consular** **medium freighter/transport** \- basically true merchant cargo hauler or passenger ship example: *gorzanti*\-class transport; gr-75; nubian j-type* **corvette** \- heavy gunships and raiders examples: c70 *charger* cr90 *blockade runner* and cr92a *assassin*; *sphyrna*\-class* **frigate** \- escort ship optimised for ship-to-ship and anti-starfighter mission example: *nebulon* series *pelta*\-class* **light cruiser** \- basically identical to frigates with overlapping tonnage but generally more heavily armed and sometimes with bigger fighter hangers example: *arqutiens*\-class *carrack*\-class* **heavy cruiser/battlecruiser** \- pre-clone wars biggest warship type optimised for ship-vs-ship combat example: *dreadnought*\-class; mc-75a; *munificent*\-class *victory*\-class* **carriers** \- proportionately lightly-armed and massively variable in size examples: *quasar fire*\-class; *ton-falk*\-class; *venator*\-class* **star destroyer/star cruiser** \- carrier/battlecruiser hybrid tend to be 50-100% larger than battlecruisers examples: mc-80a *imperial* series* **star dreadnought/star defender/super-star destroyer** \- super-sized sector command vessel intended to be able to outfight any given foe and besiege entire systems unaided; originally considered somewhat over-vulnerable and mostly defensive examples: *executor*\-class; *mandator*\-class; *viscount*\-classthe thing about star wars cap ship classes is that type designations are assigned based on role not tonnage so we have for example the *munificent* which is basically a heavy cruiser called a frigate because the banking clans marketed it as a convoy escort and star destroyer ranging from the *victory*\-class which was barely larger than the *dreadnought* to the *resurgence* which is nearly twice the length of the *imperial*\-classthis is why ive done some re-typing for my personal fanon just to make things less confusing,types of large starship in star wars - time to reorganise the lists

1739,starwars,i’ve never really watched him before so i don’t know how accurate his track record is lately he’s been saying things like kk doesn’t have control anymore windu may come back mara may be introduced and that george has been making executive decisions over kk despite the fact he has no creature control he never provides sources,how reliable is mike zeroh
1740,starwars,,mark hamill doing a perfect yoda impression

1751,starwars,,a redesign of the star wars posters for disney+
1752,starwars,for me its definitely maul vs obi if they go that far in the series,whatre you looking forward to most in the kenobi series
1753,starwars,while we’re on the topic of being emotional ha what scenes moved you emotionally whether it be on tv/moviesfor me it was the sequence of leia passing and han and ben’s convo in tros  i wasn’t a huge fan of that movie but for some reason that scene got me  definitely kudos to adam driver for acting that scene out perfectlyrunner up would be luke removing vader’s mask and vader’s subsequent death  before the prequels came out obi-wan’s description of vader was that he was “more machine than man”  after all the terrible things vader did in that last moment you saw a glimpse of his humanity  “let me look at you with my own eyes” will never not get me,most emotional scene in star wars
1754,starwars,from time to time i get the feeling that qui gon jinn is the reason so many issues as he misread the prophecy and chose anakin skywalker from tatooine then he insisted that anakin be taught the ways of the jedi even when master yoda and the council did not accept him  later anakin killed master windu when he was going to kill palpatine and allowed palpatine to survive which allowed the republic to transform into the first galactic empire and put the sith in control of the galaxy one contrary point is that anakin reveled to the jedi that chancellor palpatine was a sith lord but the council of jedi would have understood that sooner or later and foiled his plans of overthrowing the republic so if qui gon jinn hadnt chosen anakin from tatooine there was somewhat a chance that the republic would stay intact and the jedi council would still existto be fair its been sometime since ive watched the prequel trilogy so please if ive missed something or misstated something let me know the the comments thanks,qui gon jinn
1755,starwars,,what if anakin saw lux kiss ahsoka
1756,starwars,so we all know that the force is what binds all things in the universe and can only manipulated by living beings we also know that when one loses a limb their connection to the force is slightly diminished as seen by vader and many others even further we know that a force user can attune themselves to their kyber crystal to get the most out of their lightsabertldr; if a kyber crystal was implemented into a cybernetic body part lets use an arm for this question would it allow the force user to sort of gain back what was lost after they attune to it completing the hole in their body once againnot sure how it could be implemented not as a power source which kyber crystals are not but maybe as a focus of sorts,question regarding cybernetics and the force
1757,starwars,,i found this gem at the store today
1758,starwars,,unpopular star wars opinion- i enjoy the 1st acts of star wars movies better than the 2nd or 3rd
1759,starwars,title find it weird how everywhere a venator is mentioned they also call it a star destroyer probably to state its predecessor status to the *imperial* i-classbut in the clone wars did people and clones actually call the venator star destroyers i also ask this because in jedi: fallen order cal kestis shows his droid a old republic cruiser:“hey &gt;bd-1&lt; you see that star destroyer it’s a venator”so just wondering,did jedi generals and admirals actually refer to venator cruisers as star destroyers
1760,starwars,i was wondering how the community felt about the last jedi several years after the initial releasei still feel it seems like the most polarizing movie i know a lot of fans who were not happy with 7 and were able to look past the bad things in episode 8 and love the luke changes and the hyperdrive scenei know a lot of people who think 8 is an irredeemable piece of crap and they took a lot of things personally like the hyperdrive thing or the luke changesand i know a lot of people who just didn’t like the moviepersonally i always liked themovie i don’t think it’s that great i just felt really unhappy with 7 and i really wanted to like this movie i liked seeing changes with luke i liked his arc i liked how the movie was shot i know the stunt choreography is picked on but you honestly have to be trying to look for that the same thing happens in christopher nolan’s batman,it is ok to like the last jedi

1770,starwars,every time a blaster bolt hits anything unless its a plot centric control panel fizzles if its not flesh than it doesnt do much unless its from heavier blasters like on x-wings or at-ats but if it had a kyber crystal source could it do more damage from even a small rifle,would a blaster with a kyber crystal core be more powerful

1774,starwars,,worst mistake of my life
1775,starwars,i recently came up with an idea for either a multiple series or miniseries disney+ could adapt from the expanded universe the story follows the sith lord darth gravid and his descent into madness following his straying into the light side we would see all the events he set off that would set the sith back by centuries which culminated in the epic duel with his apprentice darth gean something like that would be amazing to see what do you think,idea for a live action series
1776,starwars,spoilers****so bobawhat age is he supposed to be this is four years after rotj yet he looks very old and is fatare we to believe that his battles and the sarlacc aged him beyond his years or maybe he has been eating a lotnot sure if he should have been brought back to life but it was cool i just wished they explained his survival of the sarlacc though it would have taken two lines of dialogue for god sale,question about a character in the mandalorian - spoilers

1794,starwars,star wars fan here but haven’t spent a lot of time until recently on rationale/canon/etc  does any of the material establish the general motivation for an imperial officer  it seems like a lot of risk ie wrath of emperor vader choke general death for under performance  do they live the life outside of the 9-5  i’ve always imagined them taking shifts maybe more payment but that doesn’t really mean much if you never can spend it or lost all your blood  just a thought,imperial officer incentive 
1795,starwars,,this is the way
1796,starwars,,my idea on how prequels should have ended
1797,starwars,i remembered watching it when i was in middle school on cartoon network and it was amazing as with anything tartakovsky does will we ever see this masterpiece on disney+ if disney may have the distribution rights if not when will it revert to them from wb,will we ever see genndy tartakovskys clone wars on disney+

1804,starwars,,star wars battlefront 2 mandalorian with darksaber skin mod
1805,starwars,i have a theory the mandalorian and ahsoka series will intersect at their ends both series will lead up to the introduction of snoke and a confrontation between him and luke it will be revealed gideon was working with thrawn who was in contact with palpatine on exegol this will not only explain the apparent wounds snoke sustained but why luke not only knew of snoke but also why he was looking for exegol this likewise will explain the obsession the imperial remnant soon to be first order has with obtaining studying and expirmenting with grogus midichlorian enriched blood they want to and will create a force sensitive strain-cast that palpatine can manipulate and rule indirectly through until he is able to return to full strength from beyond the grave nevertheless luke begrudgingly abandons the search for exegol after bens turn to the dark side but he is reassured by leias vision that someone in the future will redeem his nephew and return the balance to the force which anakin achieved nonetheless lukes shame and grief overcome him so he goes into exile until he is prompted to return by rey in the sequels i could be completely wrong and im alright with that but i think this would be awesome for us to see and a good way to connect the orginal trilogy to the sequels in a way almost all fans could like please tell me what you guys think and i hope youre all having an amazing day or night,just a theory i had
1806,starwars,i honestly think itd be interesting and easy to do and i can absolutely see darth vader as a anti hero if given the role of main character i think itd be cool to see elements of legends and canon used like mara jade star killer shadow guard and inquisitors at the same time id love to see the famous line the emperor is not as forgiving as i am really be demonstrated like maybe vader for once spares a soldier who despite failing a mission rectified his mistake by going back and achieving victory before vaders arrival only to learn after leaving the emperor had the soldier executed anywayi mean vader is such a good character and theres a lot that can be done with him im surprised a series hasnt been made before,should they make a darth vader tv series
1807,starwars,i have been a long time movie fan but just recently i decided to get more into the rest of the universe i’m working my way through the clone wars and then i will watch rebels and after that i plan to read some of the novels there are a lot of books though so are there any particular ones that would be considered “essential reading” for someone starting out in the expanded universe,what eu novels to read

1810,starwars,i am rewatching the revenge of the sith with my wife and i noticed something that i have never seen before but it is so obvious in the scene where anakin obi-wan and palpatine are falling in the elevator shaft palpatine lets go of obi wan and anikans feet and then grabs them again immediately before he pulls them into the open elevator entrance narrowly escaping a collision with the falling elevatorhe used his sith power to save himself and them,palpatine saves both anakin and obi wan in the elevator shaft in revenge of the sith

1852,starwars,i believe you can see tantive iv docked on admiral raddus’ ship during the arrival of the rebel fleet near the end of rogue one  so i was wonder how they got on board as i though rogue one was meant to be set just as a new hope began how long was the time period of rogue and to a new hope ,how did c3po and r2 d2 get on board of tantive iv in a new hope if they were on yavin 4 when they were attacking scariff
1853,starwars,so i’m watching episode three for the billionth time and i can’t help but be bugged by the obi vs grievous fight it’s a nitpick but the reusing of anakin’s and obi-wan’s lightsaber hilt designs just with different blade colors annoys me why not just design a new hilt i’m sure there was a reason for it but i feel it is an easy fix am i the only one bothered by this,rots lightsaber gripe
1854,starwars,,i drew darth vader
1855,starwars,out of the three films from the sequel trilogy the last jedi is the only one that i actually kinda liked the force awakens and the rise of skywalker were literally just nostalgia baited rehashes there wasnt any bit of originality in those two if i wanna watch episode 4 and 6 then i would just re-watch those films when i go to the movies i wanna see something new and interestingtlj on the other hand actually took risks and tried to be different from the original films the movie wasnt perfect and did have problems but it also did a lot of things right as wellrey starting out as a nobody and kylo ren choosing to forge his own path were actually great and interesting things also having watched rians other films like knives out and looper hes a far better director than jj abrams the best way to describe abramss filmography would be stealing ideas from other films and surface level nostalgia the nostalgia is simply used to hide the fact he cant think of an original ideawhat do you guys think,rian johnson shouldve been the director from the start of the trilogy

1885,starwars,,all occurrences of iris doors/hatches
1886,starwars,at least it seems that way i know it’s technically canon that the clone wars went on for three years but the way the characters and story evolve over time physically and emotionally makes it feel like it went on way longer a 5-6 year war sounds way more believable than a 3 year war thoughts,the clone wars lasted way longer than 3 years

1898,starwars,,my 8 inch cheese steak is bringing balance to the force
1899,starwars,**introduction:** quite recently i have decided to take up reading the star wars legends books from the new republic era on this was something i never thought id do due to the immense volume of content but watching the mandalorian has made me crave more post-rotj content and unfortunately there just isnt that much of it in the new canon since im doing it i decided to document my progress on reddit and spark some discussion about the older content thus with only a little further ado here are my thoughts on various aspects of x-wing: rogue squadron **spoiler warning:** ive already got a few of the books in the series under my belt so there may be some spoilers not only for this specific book but for some of the other x-wing books as well**synopsis:** the book follows wedge antilles as he attempts to put together a new rogue squadron one that will live up to the legends of old but also maybe not die so much most prominent among these new heroes is corran horn a former member of the corellian security force who was forced into hiding to escape from kirtan loor an imperial intelligence agent who incidentally has made it his lifes work to track corran down with his new squadron at his back wedge helps the new republic take a major step in the fight against the empire by capturing the planet of borleias a move which will allow the republic to stage an invasion of the imperial capital of coruscant which in the wake of the emperors demise is controlled by the head of imperial intelligence ysanne isard**the good:** honestly theres a lot to love in this book wedge and corran are both great characters and watching them grow and change over the course of the book and the series has been a lot of fun corrans arc in this book is a relatively simple one but not unsatisfying from his early conversation with lujayne and the groups first training mission it is clear that his arc is about moving past old prejudices learning to trust his new comrades and putting his ego aside for the greater good this all comes together towards the end when in parallel to that first training exercise he and wedge take the first run at the target they need to destroy with the intention of transmitting the targeting data back to the others if they miss corran is able to put aside his ego his desire to be the hero and take himself out of the fight trusting his comrades to get the job done wedges journey on the other hand is a little more complex his is an arc about coming to terms with loss and learning to embrace his new squadron emotionally even though he might lose them this is primarily represented by his relationship with corran and the pain he feels upon leaving him behind on borleias while he thought he had walled himself off from his new team corran managed to slip past those walls and become a dear friend much like biggs porkins and the others that rogue squadron had lost over the years when corran is revealed to be alive after all i think that really cements for wedge that its okay to care about these people to let them into his heart even if that might mean pain down the line as for other characters the book is somewhat hit or miss but ill stick to the hits for now mirax terrick is great and her budding relationship with corran is handled very well erisi too is well handled and you can already sort of sense her true loyalties though that may just be me projecting since i immediately spoiled that plot point for myself when i looked her up on wookiepedia to see what she looked like tycho is probably the last of the truly interesting characters here at least on the good side both loor and isard are smart compelling villains and isard is genuinely kind of scary at least at this point in the series as for tycho the question of whether or not hes an imperial agent makes all of his actions more interesting and wedges faith in him makes us as the readers want to have faith in him too aside from them nawara ven ooryl qrygg and bror jace are somewhat interesting but they dont really have much to dothe story and action are probably where the book excels the most stackpoles starfighter sequences are fast paced and compelling though i often have a hard time following them theyre sort of like ra salvatoreauthor of the drizzt dourden forgotten realms series as well as one of the new jedi order bookss  fight sequences: they are rendered in exacting detail but my brain struggles to process them i feel as though this is a failure on my part though rather than failure on the part of salvatore or in this case stackpole stackpole is also great at balancing wins and losses for the rogues he rides a fine line for both sides of the conflict where the central figures the rogues and isard/loor can take losses but still seem competent like the first battle of borleias which went wrong by no fault of the rogues or the attack on talasea which would likely have ended much differently had derricote listened to loor this balance is one that stackpole manages to maintain throughout his run on the series and it makes for a very compelling narrative **the bad:** the only real complaint i have is just how little many of the characters have to do and how little development they get given that fear of loss is one of the biggest motivators for wedge in the book its odd that more time isnt spent trying to develop the characters who die lujayne gets a little bit of development but even then its not really enough to make me care when she died adoorni hui barely says or does anything and peshk vrisyk literally doesnt i dont think he says a single thing or is described in any level of detail granted stackpole is working with a lot of characters here and it can be hard to balance them all but as wraith squadron demonstrates later in this series it is absolutely possible to get you to care about a squadrons worth of characters very quickly as the series goes on it becomes clear that stackpole is more interested in some of the characters surrounding rogue squadron than he is in some of those who are in it and while this is absolutely fine it just seems a waste not to at least invest a little bit of time in getting to us care about each of the rogues nawara and ooryl dont have much more to do in this book than characters like adoorni or peshk but they both have distinct personalities that endeared me to them very quickly i just wish there was a little more of that for the rest of the squadron **conclusion:** all in all this is a solid start to my legends journey corran has very quickly become one of my favorite star wars characters please please bring him into the rogue squadron movie and wedge is no slouch either though i was already pretty familiar with a version of him from the aftermath books in the new canon while i did have a few complaints about the treatment of some of the characters stackpole definitely does get better as time goes on in that regard though i dont think he ever quite gets to the point that allston does so effortlessly and immediately in wraith squadron that being said stackpole is a great story teller and this book definitely made me glad i gave legends a chance anyways ill see you all in the next post and/or the comments of this one au revoir,my trip through the legends new republic books part one: x-wing: rogue squadron

1922,starwars,sorry if this is a repost but i recently caught up with the mandalorian and had the thought that because grogu and yoda are the same race that luke may have been blinded by the idea that grogu was the only only hope for the new jedi order and by doing so he ignored ben solo and he connection to the force as a jedi could this be a possibility or is this explained in canon not to be true,does anyone else think grogu was the reason lukes jedi order failed

1926,starwars,,the real guns used in star wars
1927,starwars,i get that a lot of people don’t like the sequels personally i think they never should have been made for me they go from ‘good’ to ‘meh’ i really feel like the sheer amount and passion of some of the hate is really overblown and a little too much star wars has somewhat redeemed themselves through the mandolorian which i think deserves the praise it gets and i was beyond excited to hear about the ashoka and rangers of the new republic shows however i honestly think that the whole decanonizing the sequels ‘theory’ is ridiculous first to make sure people didn’t get confused they would have to put a video of george lucas explaining the whole situation in front of every trailer promoting material and the movie itself sure for people like you and me that probably wouldn’t be necessary but most of the ticket sales for star wars movies aren’t from the die hard fans they’re from average people who don’t keep up with star wars news as closely as some of the fans secondly why would disney accept defeat the only way a massive corporate conglomerate like them would accept defeat is if all of those movies bombed at the box office with the critics and the fans which none of them did at the same time quite a few people are freaking out about the rogue squadron movie bringing us into a new era of star wars which they swear up and down means that they are decanonizing the sequels but have none of them actually sat down and thought about it for a second i would assume that they mean new era because it’s the first movie in 4 years my apologies if this was too long,some thoughts on the de-canonizing the sequels and the “filoni-verse”

1949,starwars,i’ve been doing some research and found out many details about the original plans for the sequel trilogy from the 1980s these plans were made when lucas was still making the original trilogy episodes 4 and 5 were the same as we got in real life but episodes 6-9 were completely differentepisode 6’s main but not only villain would have been boba fett and featured the gang trying to save han solo from fett han solo would have died by the end of the film because harrison ford would not return for any more films leia was going to be a solo monarch presumably over other survivors of alderon luke would have a showdown with vader it’s unclear if vader would have survived although i doubt it luke and leia were not related in this version but it would setup luke having a twin sisterepisode 7 would have shown luke begin rebuilding the jedi order and the rebuilding of the rebuilding of the republic the latter of which would have been a main theme for the whole trilogyepisode 8 would introduce luke’s twin sister who in this version was not leia but a completely different characterepisode 9 would have been the finale with luke facing off against the emperor who would have been pulling the strings from behind the scenes the whole time the emperor would have been hiding off at the edge of the galaxy it would have jumped forward one hundred of years and reveal that r2-d2 as the narrator of star wars r2 was narrating it to the keeper of the “journal of the whills”r2-d2 and c-3po would have been the only characters to be appearing in all of them in 1988 lucas mentioned that luke would have had a romance with a female partner what do you think about these idea do you prefer them over the trilogy we got do you hate these ideas all together,lucas’s sequel trilogy from the 1980s

know in the comments so i could continue the storypart i: the twisted questat 40 bby on the planet kamino a small starship arrived called the shade this ship is able to blend in every area and is also avaiable to sail on water surfaces  and to dive underneath the water surfaces at the deep bottoms of oceans lakes etcthe ship landed on a small landplatform with a small old village attached to it on the surfaces of the water planet the weather is as always very stormy a gate on the starship opened and a tall silhoutte appeared the silhoutte was walking slowly out of the ship this person wore a long black cloakthe cloaked figure walked at the footpath wich was located through the middle of the road all the vehicles who drove past the cloaked figure took a look at the figure but then drove out of fear accelerated further awaythe figure entered an old inn called the big bith at the entrance of the inn the figure  his hood and revealed his pale otollan gungan face the crowd took a short look at the gungan but they werent really afraid the gungan walked further in the inn and walked towards an aged bith bartender at the counter of the inn and said i need a room the bartender took a weird look at the gungan because he didnt spoke like a a gungan but talked like a regular person with a low voice but the bartender answered anyway and said im sorry sir but were full the gungan got angry and said there are still rooms avaiable and you will give me one the bartender couldnt resist his words and said there are still rooms avaiable and i will give you one upon which the gungan answered good you will give me room 3 and give the next jedi quarren visitors the same room as me and wont tell them about me the bartender answered i will give you room 3 and give the next jedi quarren visitors the same room as you and i wont tell them about you the gungan answered silently pathetic mind and walked to his room the bartender looked confused to the gungan and saw the next visitors coming in and it were the very persons the gungan describedthe jedi quarrens wore jedi robes with their lightsabers attached they were were looking for a sith from wich they heard rumors of the first quarren was an aged jedi master and the second one was still a young padawan the look of the two quarren looked very similar they had a brown skin color the only difference between them was just the height they were walking towards the counter of the inn and the old jedi master said im looking for a room for me and my son just for one night the son continued were looking for someone called- the old master interrupted his son on an agry tone he doesnt need to know that profogo the bartender answered you are lucky there is just one room left room 3 the jedi master thanked the bartender gave the credits and went to his and his padawans room when they arrived at the door of their room the door was slowly opening with a loud creak profogo looked frightened to his master but his master eased him when they stood at the entrance of the door they saw a lamp-enlightened figure looking through the window to the waves of the wild kaminoan oceans the figure stood with his back to the master and his padawan and said domanos profogo what a suprise so your son is finally allowed as your padawan that took a while the jedi master domanos replied with an angry tone thats none of your business weve been tracking you since naboo now youll finally pay for your crimes you did to the republic and its people darth tibos the gungan replied unfortunately for you you dont know my real name you dont know what is yet to come and besides i was tracking you two domanos was confused and uncomfortable but tibos continued you two have revealed some very useful information to me but now the only thing i need is your and your padawans death tibos took his lightsaber from his robe and ignited the red double-edged lightsaber which revealed tibos  pale downtrodden scarred face with the light coming from the sabre then he turned him to domanos and said now give your little pathetic life to me domanos and profogo ignited their lightsabers as well domanos quickly told to profo be careful son and remember what i told you focus and trust in the forcedomanos made a force jump to the ceilling and pushed himself from the ceilling and attacked tibos with his blue lightsaber the two were in a furious duel while profogo was waiting to blend in the fight but at the moment he was ready to jump in the duel tibos stabbed domanos in his heart in the front of his sons eyes profogo ran angrily towards tibos ready to give him an uppercut but tibos force-pushed profogo and his lightsaber out of the window profogo knew he wouldnt stand a chance so he ran back to his fathers ship and started the engines meanwhile tibos walked slowly to the corpse of domanos and reached his hands out to the dead master and absorbed his life energy which gave his face color again maked him younger and healed his scars tibos didnt care about the young padawan anymore he already get what he wanted the energy of a jedi-master and acces to the holocrons on coruscant meanwhile profogo already departed with his fathers ship away from kamino to his family home on dantooine his father didnt followed the jedi code to protect him and make him a jedi-knight he sacrificed so many for me said profogo silently in his head lets make it worth it he continued meanwhile tibos departed his ship as well time for the next step said he silently while setting the coordinates to naboo,darth jar jar:

1970,starwars,quick summary:**legends**: the clones are shady from the start they know their true purpose and willingly execute order 66 the clones have unquestioning loyalty and murder their jedi generals in cold-blood the clones are completely aware of their actions reference: 501st journal**canon**: the clones are implanted w/ inhibitor chips at the earliest stages of their development when palpatine issues order 66 these chips activate and forces the clones to comply w/ order 66 the inhibitor chips takes away the clones’ agency and individuality**personal opinion**: i prefer the retcon canon version as its more logical prior to tcw the legends version made sense because the clones barely had any character development except for that they have unquestioning loyalty however tcw has portrayed the clones as individuals who developed personalities made decisions and defied orders they deemed wrong the jedi and clones developed strong bonds as tcw progresses i doubt palpatine would’ve taken the risk to allow the clones to keep their agency ones order 66 is enacted also it’s cruel how the inhibitor chips takes away the clones’ agency and individualityregardless i believe both versions of the arc is good w/ respect to their respective universe and timelines,order 66 - do you prefer canon or legends

1991,starwars,before you come here to say that’s not canon that’s entirely my question whenever i see someone say qui-gon was a grey jedi or grey jedi gets brought up in general everyone’s response is that grey jedi aren’t canon my question is where does this term come from is it from legends is it a term that was just made up out of nowhere i see it brought up in discussion and i’m just curious of the origins of this term,question about grey jedi

1997,starwars,like many ive eagerly awaited the kenobi series obi-wan is my all time favorite star wars character and i cant wait for ewan mcgregor to get another crack at himhowever i never dreamed that a kenobi series might reunite obi-wan and vader and upon the initial announcement of the rematch of the century my nerdy brain started puzzling as to how that would even workive since come to believe that not only is there room for the rematch but its also a golden opportunity for star wars to shore up some movie canon lines like the one in the title with some context case in point as it currently stands vaders pronouncement that obi-wan also believed there was still good in him doesnt quite jive with what we see in revenge of the sith in that film obi-wan doesnt make much of an effort to save anakin they start fighting each other almost as soon as vader stops choking padme obi-wan makes it clear he doesnt want to kill anakin and even warns him before the final blow but thats not the same as trying to return anakin to the lightnow comes the kenobi series and wouldnt it be a bit unexpected if obi-wan wracked with guilt and trying to complete his training with qui-gon sets out after vader in the hopes of redeeming him only to have his good intentions dashed when vader tries with all his might and machinelike ferocity to destroy him leading obi-wan to conclude that anakin truly has been destroyed by darth vaderi dont know this is kind of rambly but i think there could be some exciting drama to be mined in  vader/kenobi rematch beyond just the spectacle of a light saber fight,obi-wan once thought as you do: my hopes for the kenobi series

2001,startrek,it’s such a waste of time and kills the pacing there could’ve been two or three more minutes of real dialog or action in his episodes,why did they make vic fontaine sing songs all the way through or almost all the way
2002,startrek,what if a group of planets got tired of starfleet letting horrible things happen in the name of the prime directive so they seceded from the federation and created their own utopia   with their own fleet of ships  that they built in secret for a decade  then when the federation wont stop horrible things from happening because of the prime directive they can swoop in and do something about it   because they arent part of the federation   they should have rules against getting involved in primitive civilizations  but those rules should be flexible and there should be exceptions  especially for preventing planetary disasters  they should also have rules against time travel  but they should be flexible too and time travel should be allowed especially to stop galaxy wide disasters  i wonder what the federations response would be to something like this  and what would they do if there was an even better utopia right next door  they would either have to change or watch as their member worlds left to join the new and better utopia  also i would hope the new utiopia would arm their ships much better and have much better planetary defenses  so that they are prepared for war  they dont want war and wont start a war but are more then prepared for it when it shows up on their doorstep  also it would be wise for their citizens to be armed and for their ships to have the latest defenses   that way they can oppose the government if it becomes corrupt and or a hostile invader  so let me know what you think in the comments,what if a group of planets seceded from the federation and built their own utopia

2004,startrek,ive been bingeing star trek  tng ds9 and now voyager  there are a few great episodes that have stood the test of time  but every season there seems to be at least one time travel episode and every other season an alternate reality episode  ds9 had that other dimension where major kira was bad and worf was bad but other characters were good  then they made a device that could transport to the other reality at will  they re-visit this dimension 4 or 5 times in the series  did not like  the characters would have petty reasons for going to the other dimensionon voyager they end up being transported to earth in the 90s  then they have a mission to stop this catastrophe that will occur in the future and they are the only ones that can stop it  they are successful and then end up back in the delta quadrant  i meancmon  we have to preserve the timeline until we decide not toalso ds9 had an episode where quark rom and nog had a plasma leak and end up on earth in the 1950s  it seems that time travel can happen pretty easily and its pretty easy to get backam i the only one who gets annoyed by these time travel episodes,opinion: star trek does a bad job with time travel and alternate reality spoilers
2005,startrek,i’d opt for christopher nolan or ridley scott thoughts,which film director would you like to see helm a star trek reimagining
2006,startrek,as i was watching some tng yesterday i had a question about what ship became the federation flagship after the enterprise-d but more broadly how federation flagships work in generalthe enterprise-d was the federation flagship until its destruction given picards line about it prior to the battle with the klingons i suppose we could assume the enterprise-e was the flagship afterward but i dont think we have any established dialogue to that effect  had the enterprise-d not been destroyed would it have remained the flagship until decommissioning or destruction even if more advanced starships been commissioned such as the sovereign class whose development and likely construction was taking place prior to the enterprise-ds destruction,question about the federation flagship
2007,startrek,i’m watching st: first contact for the hundredth time i realized why the heck didn’t the federation decide to develop borg-specific projectile weapons like we have today like m-16s and shit i get it it’s a show and a fantastic one at that but seems obvious to me now,regarding the borg

2009,startrek,,i really tried😔
2010,startrek,i might be inciting a riot but here it goes:id like to point out that what is now old trek such as tng ds9 etc was once new trek and what greeted with the same criticism thats applied to new trek today  i look at all the shows as glimpses into different parts of the st universe and also that as society evolves thus trek evolves with itor as the vulcans say infinite diversity in infinite combinationsor to paraphrase billy joel hot trek cool trek even if its kelvin trek its still all star trek to me,old trek vs new trek
2011,startrek,it seems so weird to me for example the enterprise-d is regularly considered the strongest ship of the federation in the best of both worlds for example but a single romulan warbird of which there appear to be many can seemingly turn it into a smoking pile of debris without much effort from what i remember it was the same in kirks encounters with the klingons i understand that the mission of the federation is peaceful in nature but these are known enemies one would assume that a spaceship that is likely to act near and sometimes in the neutral zone should be equipped with the means to defend itself am i just being an idiot i dont claim to have a broad understanding of star trek lore - im currently busy going through tng im missing tos almost entirely and have yet to finish voyager - but its a recurring theme that has bothered me,why is the federation always outgunned
2012,startrek,theres a really fascinating split between the average critical reception of each series and movie compared with what the fandom generally believes to be the best ill admit to being surprised by quite a few of the scores from rotten tomatoes which aggregates multiple reviews into a single average scoreordering best to worst according to an average of critical reviews the franchise looks something like this:**television**1 tas: 94%2 ds9: 90%3 tng: 89%4 pic: 87%5 dsc: 85%6 tos: 80%7 voy: 77%8 lds: 65%9 ent: 57%**film**1 st09: 94%2 fc: 92%3 twok: 88%4 bey: 86%5 id: 84%6 tuc: 82%7 tvh: 81%8 tsfs: 79%9 gen: 48%10 ins: 54%11 tmp: 41%12 nem: 38%13 tff: 21%right off the bat theres a massive difference between fan perception and general perception - star trek 09 is the best received star trek film beating out first contact and wrath of khanim also quite surprised to see the animated series come out as the best reviewed show while the lower decks appearing so low is equally surprisingon the not-so-controversial list i dont expect many people will be making passionate defences against the final frontier being the worst star trek film however id argue enterprise deserves a slot closer to voyagers score,looking at the franchise by critical reception throws up some interesting divergency with the fandoms general views
2013,startrek,,a newish-comer’s take on discovery: im absolutely loving it

2019,startrek,with the jump into the far future in the 3rd season of disco we have the chance to be reintroduced to old friends with new twists the vulcans and romulans are now reunited earth has become isolationist and even the federation itself is dramatically altered in size and  in character in this far future we may wonder about the other races we knew so well where are the klingons and cardassians what will the borg look like in this futurebut we need not wonder about the ferengi they will never be seen in this future how can i be sure of thisit’s because the ferengi have already been reintroduced  they are hiding in plain sight and are now called the orions in this future the orions have become all of the things that the ferengi were or more accurately they have become all of the things that the ferengi should have been before they were turned into a joke let’s think back to the start of tng the ferengi were supposed to be the main villains of tng it was an interesting choice in tos the main villains were the klingons and the main philosophical debate was between cooperation the federation and conquest the klingons this conflict mirrored the cold war reality at that time between the usa and russia in tng the main philosophical debate was going to be cooperation the federation vs capitalism the ferengi but sadly this was not the case the ferengi bombed and the romulans took their place but now in disco it seems like we have come back to the start of tng at least philosophically cooperation vs capitalism the only difference is that the ferengi have been replaced by orions but have the ferengi really been replaced perhaps the ferengi have just been reskinnedlet’s look at the main villain of the 3rd season of disco osyraa she looks like an orion but she sure does act like a ferengi i wouldn’t be surprised if she had a copy of the rules of acquisition in her back pocket she certainly follows the rules of acquisition quite closely here are some examples of osyraa following the rules of acquisition “ the riskier the road the greater the profit” 62nd rule she is a risk-taker osyraa takes big risks looking for big payoffs stealing discovery and taking it to the federation was a big gamble “know your enemies but do business with them always” 177th rule she is a businessperson who makes deals to get what she wants after she got discovery past the federation’s shields what did she do attack like a klingon no she tried to make a deal how ferengi can you get“never ask when you can take”  52nd rule of course osyraa is not always so polite when she has the upper hand she does as she pleases “there is no honor in poverty” 106th rule “my ancestors knew that power is virtue and there is no nobility in suffering “ osyraa nuff said “never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity” 6th rule osyraa killed her nephew as she said herself  “you do what it takes to get what you need or you don’t”  “beware the man who doesnt take time for oo-mox” 223rd rule ferengi believe that people should enjoy the sensual pleasures of life osyraa is very sensual  look at the way she sat on the captains chair after she took discovery from tilly she took time to enjoy her victory “learn the customers weaknesses so that you can better take advantage of him” 87th rule osyraa is very manipulative she has her chief scientist aurelio thinking that she will save the universe as she saved him “hear all trust nothing” 190th rule ferengi see nothing wrong with telling lies lies are a natural part of communication among ferengi trying to figure out what someone is lying about is part of the fun of social interaction as far as ferengi are concerned thus when osyraa is talking about the lie detector holo she says “where’s the fun in that” every time i look at osyraa i see a ferengi but waityou might say that she is a woman ferengi women are not allowed to engage in businessin this case we can assume that rom’s reforms of ferengi society have taken hold and women are now equal to men in ferengi society,there will never be ferengi in disco spoilers
2020,startrek,star trek has memorable characters with some degree of identity crises — eg spock data dax especially ezri odo the doctor seven and even tpol — and quite generally it is an important component in the character development but not the only interesting aspect of their personality today i was thinking about how underutilized belanna wasjust for comparison spock had his quarrels with mccoy the friendship with kirk data explored many aspects of humanity we could even compare belanna with ezri the latter had just one season but her development was decent for six seasons belanna was the competent engineer &amp; tough half-klingon thats it eventually the writers remembered ohh we can explore her background - her mother was introduced in the 6th season barge of the dead - very good episode and her father in the 7th season lineage her maquis background is just a footnote - my goodness these episodes could have been fantasticthere are some underutilized characters in the franchise at least half of voyagers ensemble but belanna is probably the best its sad that she didnt have many opportunities to shine,my 2 cents on belanna torres
2021,startrek,when i think about how star trek treats disability i think of geordi and his blindness on first thought it seems handled very well they managed to effectively remove his disablility and he can function as if he were not blindbut the more i think about it is this the right way to treat disabilitythere are two ways to do it: modify the environment for the person or modify the person for the environment what happened to geordie was the latter but what we seem to do in our society is the former we try to make accomodations for people whereas they didnt even need to make changes to the environment to accomodate geordies disabilitywhen i think of another example of blindness - tukov in year of hell - this was done differently tuvok had a tactile interface in order to use the console this was an example of modifying the environment to accomodate an individual which i think is a better way of dealing with disability rather than just writing it out with a visor so i end up thinking that they actually handled geordies blindness poorlyanother example of disability is in ds9 melora which i watched recently its about a person who is incredibly weak in normal gravity their solution is a radical medical procedure and at no point was it considered to modify the environment to suit her disability it was such an obvious solution to have her work in a low g environment but they made no accomodation for her disabilitythis leaves me to conclude that star trek handles disability very poorly what are your thoughts,how do you think star trek handles disability

2030,startrek,like in fallout 3  wouldnt that be interesting  maybe that is why no one has seen him  maybe only vance knows that the president is a computer  and they just accept it because its classified and they dont have a need to know  the federation in discovery season three does seem a lot like the enclave in the fallout games  except they arent as evil and dont have cool power armor,what if the federation president is a computer
2031,startrek,i kept waiting each season for him to arrive as some new memorable character as he always does i find it hard to believe that they haven’t approached him do you think he has turned down the opportunity or they haven’t offered him a role yet,finally caught up on discovery - where is jeffrey combs
2032,startrek,,just for fun what do you imagine barclay is up to in the st: picard timeline
2033,startrek,thats actually the federation president isnt itthat look vance gave him/it when osyraa asked who it was modeled after,the lie detector program spoiler
2034,startrek,she broke the prime directive more than a few times but where it counted the 37s the enarans she stuck to federation principles more than any other captain ever  change my mind,hot take: janeway was the most federation captain ever
2035,startrek,wouldnt other races have taken over by now what about the pre-warp civilizationsseveral hundred years was enough to get earth from industrial revolution to warp its hard to imagine that nobody in federation space would have come up with a way to warp without dilithium,watching disc s3 with my brother dont romulans use a singularity rather than dilithium
2036,startrek,it is the best season 1not tos not tng voyager is the best season 1,voyager season 1 hotake
2037,startrek,s1 e12 kai opaca says that her pah and siskos pah will meet again does that ever come to fruition ive watched the series a few times but i dont recall that happening,ds9 plot hole

2039,startrek,i have been wanting to learn some klingon for a while but everything i find uses english letters rather than the ipa which is much easier for me it would also help to learn sentence structure first then words,know where to learn klingon from the ipa
2040,startrek,so this question probably doesnt make any sense but i felt the need to ask it regardless heres the more specific version: power in this context is rated in three categories with some subcategories : 1v1 fist fight and ranged race vs race space and ground and starship competence crew member and captain all races have access to the exact same resources with technology coming from starfleet for equal measurments superiority in the categories can be achieved through extreme excellence in one aspect or a more general competence this rule is restricted to races of a sizable population so no one man races stability no races that are going extinct organic nature no artificially created races and single dimensional status no q or others like them the idea behind this question is to determine which race could beat the most others in the three listed categories hopefully the discussion can stay on more well known races but if theres an obscure race out there thats faster stronger smarter etc that can win without cheating with reality warping  then they are who i am looking for,what is the strongest federation race
2041,startrek,i thought it was ds9 but i cant find anything there was episode where a federation ship found a cube but it wasnt functioning at all then they went down to a planet and found a bunch of borg that were still connected but not part of the collective one of them was a human lady that became a love interest of the ships crew but she was wearing a wig to hide that she was a borgthen they connected with one of the crew to heal/save him and then that cube near the planet was destroyedin the end this mini-collective took advantage of the federation ship and its crew for reasons that i remember as being deviousthey werent strickly borg anymore but they really liked the connectiondoes any of this sound familiar,i need help identifying a episode with disconnected quasi-borg group
2042,startrek,look i get ithe can be annoyingbut neelix is a guy who will go the extra mile for the crew does he take it too far he can does he have flaws sure thing is neelix always tried to help those around him as best he can,a take on neelix
2043,startrek,if mirror georgiou was still on discovery they would have retaken the ship in five minutes  she may be evil but she was a badass  there are advantages to having a terran crew member  they are good in a fire fight  so if she was still there the chaiin wouldnt stand a chance  and they would easily retake the ship,if mirror georgiou was still on discovery they would have retaken the ship in five minutes

2048,startrek,this is my personal guess:federation: usaklingons: russiaromulus: germanycardasia: japani may be wrong and i am missing a lot of races what do you guys think i am just curious,i have heard that each star trek race was a country if that is true what country is each one

2054,startrek,,people dont freeze instantly in space boo writers boo
2055,startrek,i just thought id put it out there i like discosure its different than other star treks but i still think its goodone of the things i like about it is re-watching the season when you know the end and then you catch things that you didnt get the first time  sure there are some things that niggle me but it took me years to rewatch voyager as janeway annoyed me so much the first 2 seasons and arguably the 3rd season of tng were not much good eitherso there im a fan some positivity for a change,i really like discovery
2056,startrek,i think there is plenty of criticism from trekkies/trekkers regarding *discovery* and probably for good reason but i think it is important not only to determine what is wrong but suggest what would be a better alternative we should also note what they are currently doing right but that isnt my topic here im just an old-fashioned country trekker not used to these fancy big city streaming programs so i am aware i may just have unreasonable expectations in wanting this show to be like the other shows i know and love i also think its important to note the learning curve on most trek shows has tended to be about three seasons   remember the ferengi or doctor pulaski or the kazon im hoping thats the case here&amp;#x200b;heres what i want from discovery that im obviously not getting now:1 **i want a show that focuses on the** ***crew*** **of discovery not on one individual character** if they are paying these actors to be on the bridge through three seasons why do i know only half of their names2 **i want a show that at least occasionally has individual episodes that have nothing to do with a wider universe a huge story arc or anything outside the episode** just a good self-contained 3-act episode about a crazy planet they find or a mysterious ship adrift in space etc with the current formula you cant have genius stories like the inner light i swear *breaking bad* ruined tv on this front; every show has to be written like a damn soap opera nowadays and yes get off my damn lawn you kids3 **i want a show that takes a breath every once in awhile** slow down the pace dammit show these people *living their lives* you know like the poker games on the enterprise-d or the crew hanging out in ten forward note that there doesnt always have to be a dramatic argument whisper or loud or physical fight going on as is apparently mandatory on the uss discovery4 **i want a show that at least occasionally has a clear message based on the actual plot of the episodes** sure there are plenty of speeches but they rarely have anything to do with the episode and usually theyre just talking about how great the federation is thats not actually an ethical message its just politics and/or propaganda5 **similarly i want a show that follows consistent ethical standards** discovery presents us with the most morally ambiguous trek series and depiction of starfleet until they get to the future where the one and only admiral is super wise but i dont know if this is actually a good thing especially since it takes place in the prime universe where we have been conditioned to believe that starfleet and the federation are almost always attempting to do what is right how do we go from discovery with its lying scheming and machinations to the super-enlightened uss enterprise only a few years later if kirk picard sisko or janeway were captain burnham would be in the brig and georgiou would have been tried for war crimes/genocide/whatever other heinous crimes shes clearly perpetrated6 **i would like a show that will present an enlightened perspective on social issues beyond simply having a diverse crew** this show has way too many characters thrown in simply to represent some demographic and they dont even have enough time to do the characters justice im not gonna name names but there are some characters on this show that barely have a name or are simply one-dimensional but are clearly included so we can have one of them in the show thats actually the opposite of progressive; its called tokenism there is a fine line here if you have a complex character and you decide to cast a minority that is progressive if you hastily throw in a minority at the last minute so they can stand in the background that is   sigh an all-too-common practice in tv and movies probably asking too much here7 **i want a show that isnt afraid to tackle tough philosophical and/or contemporary issues** you know like star trek used to do even if the message seems dated to us now the episode let the be your last battlefield from tos was very relevant and made a powerful statement when it aired likewise the outcast from tng though dated to our eyes took an honest stab at dealing with many aspects of sexuality and gender politics it would be less dated if they hadnt toned it down from the original conception and jonathan frakes was totally down with it too according to interviews   but were stuck with what they made 8 **i want a show that stays in one universe for the most part** jumping timelines/universes is the scifi screenwriting equivalent of and then he woke up just plain lazy it can be interesting in small doses but not if you turn half the show into that it give writers an easy way out if they get backed into a corner by a story9 **i want** ***fun*** **episodes** anyone remember the trouble with tribbles it may not be an absolute laugh riot but its cute and makes you chuckle which is really all that needs to happen i couldnt imagine an episode like that taking place in the current discoveryverse10 **i want a show that sets limits on itself** you know like the fact that the ship can only go so fast or transporters have a limited range or people cant *just go anywhere instantly* when the enterprise d is being chased by a borg cube and they cant outrun it thats genuinely frightening discovery is at serious risk of giving itself the superman problem wherein there are no real stakes because they have too many incredible powerstl;dr: i want a show that is star trek in more than name only,the ten things i want from discovery as a trekker

2062,startrek,bear in mind that this is based on my subjective taste and what i enjoy in a tv show i totally get that my opinions are weird and not universal i just want to try and explain why i am so frustrated with this particular aspect of discovery among others i watch discovery every week i enjoy it the good parts keep me slogging through the bad parts and there are way more good parts goddamn did i love seeing human saru now with that said things i hate about burnham as a character: - her emotional reactions are tiring;- her dialog is quite often badly written melodrama - she cries too much - the show focuses on her instead of more interesting characters - the other characters worship her for no good reason - she wins by being right when she didnt have enough data to know it - she seems to be specifically designed as the most extreme version of a mary sue it is possible to have remember that episode of futurama with welshy and the trekkie fanboy energy being who forced the tos crew to play out his bad fanfiction now that you hate me let me try to win you back things i love about burnham as a character:- her relationship with book i love it when those two are together they have brilliant chemistry especially when the cat is involved all hail queen grudge - when her and book were off the ship and having adventures together i enjoyed the show so much more i hoped like mad that the season would be half michael and book wander the galaxy saving endangered species and half the discovery crew get to shine without burnham getting in their damn way episodes- her getting high on drugs and infiltrating  a market was fantastic- her and spock bounced off each other really well i really got the brother-sister vibe - shes great in action scenes i love seeing her fight klingons or indeed anyone see all those points and more are how i know its not sonequa martin-greens fault at all i am outraged at the writers/showrunners for doing this to a perfectly good actor its like robert pattinson in twilight or deniro in a sandler movie discovery is so frustrating theres so many good people working on it it has such great ideas but too often executed so badly with lazy writing and idiot plots anyway hope that helped you understand why people go on and on about burnham while still really loving this mycelial-network mirror-universe lgbt as fuck diverse forward-thinking defiantly itself genuine star trek show :p s the characters i love unreservedly some of who are part of why i keep watching who i always want more of: saru stamets culver adira admiral vance tilly although making her first officer was dumb af jett reno lorca pike and emperor georgiou although the crew should have kept hating her as hard as the ds9 crew hated dukat another incomprehensible writing decisioncoherently yours,things i love things i hate about michael burnham

2066,startrek,,star trek: enterprise: fans are devoting time and effort to revive the series
2067,startrek,i just finished watching it and oddly enough did it in two half sittings not intentionally- just was busy at the time my second sitting started half way through and i realized how it felt like a completely separate episode due to the plot switch from an angry crew to a court scenei enjoyed the episode though it’s definitely no measure of a man but it could’ve been they should have made the second portion of the episode it’s own story one that truly discusses hologram rights and dedicates the time to it moam is my fave tng ep because it’s so powerful and voy could have had their own version the doctor writing his own story about hologram struggles is also a great plot idea though wish he make an autobiography instead would’ve had the message that holograms can make their own decisions and be their own people rather than creating a darker version of tuvix the episode definitely lacked focus somewhat and i wish it had focused on one or the other rather than combining both,author author should’ve been two separate episodes
2068,startrek,ive seen all the games star wars has been getting it makes me wonder why we dont get star trek ones imagine a star trek battlefront style where we can have ground troops fighting dominion borg etc or a single story campaign / open world game i can see a lot of money being made off this any reason why they wouldnt make it,new star trek game

2072,startrek,,if you had a chance to write season 3 of disco what would you change and why
2073,startrek,piggy backing on the wizard of oz theory thats been floating around lately i think that everyone at starfleet headquarters is a holo probably the ships too the big light beam thing in the center of headquarters is a giant emitter noone associated with the federation and no federation ship is ever seen outside of headquarters with the exception of the guy from the premiere there is noone from the present day federation on the discovery when there really really should be admiral vance gives orders but no federation ships are seen anywhere except inside the bubble i think there is a conspiracy of two between an federation ai and the sphere data with the goal of helping the discovery refound the federation,ahead of the finale heres a poorly thought out wild theory about disco
2074,startrek,she is the main character for the show not the captain or anybody else it has always been the case since the show was first announced that the mc would be the number one ie michael burnham i see all these criticisms and arguments about her being the focus of the show while many of them make a good point which im also inclined to agree but thats like arguing kirk or picard or sisko or janeway or archer are getting the spotlight she might be written poorly thats the writers fault not the characters the show does revolve around her this is as much about burnham and her crew as tng was about picard and his gang so those of you with misgivings understandable as it may be about burnham getting so much attention in the show lets hope they write her better moving forward as she will still be the center of attention for as long as this show exists whether you like it or not,all this talk about burnham being the center of discovery yall seem to forget
2075,startrek,ive loved trek my whole life grew up obsessed with tng loved ds9 but had trouble getting into voyager i pushed through the first season and now im really getting into it i am on season 2 episode 3 projections i just got so excited to see reg in this episode good ol nervous goofy reg thats all o just wanted to share how happy it made me with people who get it,life long trek fan watching voyager for the first time
2076,startrek,,philippa georgiou was my favorite character &amp; now she’s gone 😣
2077,startrek,this was initially a comment in response to a thread thats since been locked in my humble opinion i think that 13 episode seasons is partially whats killing discovery this season and has held it back in the previous two without the 10-15 bottle episodes we got with tng/ds9/voy we dont get to see the character growth were being told is happening off screen if we had episodes driven by and focused on other characters the focus on burnham as the central character wouldnt seem so stark and overbearing - it would be more like your sisko-focussed episodes during the last couple of seasons of ds9 also it would let discovery breathe a bit were in the 32nd century they have the spore drive lets do some discovering revisit more old trek species visit a planet still in the federation - we havent seen any yet interact with other starfleet ships and crews - im dying to see what the voyager-j bridge is like or who her captain is show us how other crews react to a 900-year old museum ship appearing and expecting to join the fleet explore the new technologies that are suddenly available to a crew 900 years out of place - give me some goddamn technobabble discovery likes to tell us what starfleet and the federation is all about but the writers and producers of the show dont seem to realise that star trek isnt all about the plot arc getting from a to b to c and wrapping things up with a tidy little bow its the human stories that go alongside it that shows us things like la forge and datas friendship seven of nine becoming more human in discovery it could easily show why the bridge crew got to like/respect georgiou or how the crew got to grips with their new normal in a much reduced federationthere are so many stories crying out to be told in this new universe but 13 episodes aint enough /rant apologies to the mods if this comes across as another discovery = bad post or breaches any rules i am enjoying this season but feel theres a ton of unfulfilled potential going to waste,bottle episodes in discovery mild spoilers

2080,startrek,why does discovery have warp nacelles it was built with the spore drive its possible that an existing ship design was used and the spore drive was just added on but why build two whole nacelles did it ever travel by warpare they used in impulse propulsion but theyre called warp nacelles not impulse nacelles,dis ship design
2081,startrek,based on reading the first half before it got deleted it seemed perfectly valid and civil with nothing inappropriate so did the comments an explanation for what was wrong with it would be nice censuring something without explanation is not in the spirit of this group or star trek in general,why did the admins delete the post with “valid criticisms of discovery”

2084,startrek,after watching a really good episode of voyager year of hell on watch party with a streamer last night and then watching the first episode of tng i decided to look into what is hurting the new series and why people seem to hate them in the search for what makes those series inferior i found a lot of anger and in-fighting about all of the series and each of the films i understand that there is a lot of change between series and they arent all for everyone but it was like everywhere i turned fans were fighting fans about why star trek sucks im usually one to be able to ignore the bad parts of a fanbase see: ween and undertale but as somebody who has been searching for a jumping-on point for several years im wondering if its really worth it if the fans seem to hate every series for example in the comments of an article about what people disliked about picard there was a long comment chain where everyone just trashed tng tos and voyager as well as discovery lower decks and picard of course along with people insulting others countries languages and cultures is this what i have to look forward to completely missing the entire point of a bunch of the plotlines  id like to hope that those fans are simply a minority but it still makes me question whether to continue watching if a fanbase hates the thing theyre a fan of so much id love to have a bit of insight from folks who have watched the show for ages and im positive my grandmother hasnt been paying much attention to star trek lately,so im really unsure if i want to continue getting into star trek
2085,startrek,in this episode heart of glory the enterprise unwittingly rescues a couple klingon fugitives even apart from the simple fact theyre klingons these guys are dangerousso when its discovered that they are wanted by the klingons picard sends a fucking security team to arrest them and take them to ~~the brig~~ security why doesnt he use site to site transportation a fight doesnt break out yet but when theyre ready to transport the prisoners to the klingon battle cruiser picard **again** sends a security team to escort them to the transporter room not to mention they dont notice the two klingons openly assembling a disruptor in the cell so ofc the klingons kill at least two starfleet officersi understand maybe in the interest of fairness that picard would want to alert the klingon fugitives to their situation but you can do that **and** use site-to-site transportis this a plot hole do they address this in the episode and i didnt hear it did anyone else notice this i couldnt find reference to this anywhere online**tl;dr**: in this episode they forgo the use of site-to-site transport when moving klingon prisoners/fugitives opting for escort by human security team this gets two officers killed why dont they use the tech why cant i find anything about this onlinethe tech is inconsistent here compared to later seasons but this one really stood out to me as stupid thank you,st: tng s1e19 the whole plot of this episode hinges on them *not* using the transporter when they easily can and obviously should

2089,startrek,i dont think its wrong or illegitimate to dislike michael burnham honestly im kind of meh on her myself but i think the hatred for her is a bit over-the-topyou cant win if youre burnham if the show portrays you as a capable hero who gets kicks ass and gets shit done the fandom cries: shes a mary sue shes too perfect its not star trek and its lazy writing if the show portrays you as being a good-hearted but kinda screwed-up person who grows and changes sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse the fandom cries: shes not starfleet material this isnt roddenberrys vision for humanity its not star trek and its lazy writingbasically what im learning here is that that a huge chunk of the fandom has started from the premise that michael burnham doesnt belong on star trek and then proceeded to look for reasons whyand if her mistakes and flaws and bad decisions *do* turn out to have consequences theyre never *enough* she needs to be punished *more* for the heinous crime of being michael burnhamlike i said: im not the biggest burnham fan shesfine like luke skywalker is fine or harry potter is fine or neo is fine or james t kirk is fine a lot of protagonists for action-adventure stories are often just solid viewpoint characters surrounded by a much more interesting supporting cast personally i tend to  find the secondary characters more fun and compellingbut that doesnt make me hate the protagonists for having the job of being protagonistsagain if you dont like burnham i cant tell you youre wrong for having that opinion unless its because of her race or gender i guess but other than that i just dont see why this much of the fandoms emotional energy needs to be expended on hating a character who in a lot of episodes isjust kind of *there*,the extreme hatred for burnham is a little weird

2098,startrek,i care about star trek ive probably spent more time watching this franchise than any other and up until a few weeks ago i was a staunch defender of discovery despite its lack of continuity like many series before it i thought it would figure things out and hit its stride somewhere around season 3 i was wrongpast shows got better by eliminating their weaknesses and focusing on their strengths unnecessary or weak plots and characters are jettisoned and better plots and characters are brought in everything gets tweaked until they land on something that feels right we go from this:  warehouse find: image wordpresscom to this:  star\trek\next\generationjpg 1920×1080 cbsstaticcom and then they settle on it and do deep dives into character development entire episodes are dedicated to learning about various crew members and how they are a special and integral part of the team over time you find yourself caring about the entire crew and their relationships more this is done organically through good writing the way riker handles being abducted the way picard handles living another life in the matter of a few minutes how geordi handles being turned into an alien how the rest of the crew handles those situations together\---when they settled on saru being captain of discovery i sighed in relief i was getting tired of them flipping through captains saru is my favorite character too that episode about his past and his home planet was really enlightening and made me connect with him i love stories about characters who grow and become bigger and stronger than they thought they could finally i thought the show can find an identity anchored by a really great characterbut all through season 3 the plot kept getting forced toward michael in ways that make no sense ill just focus on one right nowwhy is michael at the center of solving the burn and why was her strategy for finding it not already explored before she arrived the technique she used to pin-point the source of the burn is probably the only option they had yet she was the only one to think of it for some perspective: as far back as 132 ad ancient china had developed a seismometer to pin point the location of earthquakes yet this super advanced society thousands of years more advanced cant even *imagine* looking for discrepancies that might help it find a source of the burn ----- until michael burnham arrives want to know why the show 24 fizzled out its because the writers couldnt continually write jack bauer into the center of everything going on in the united states without it becoming ridiculous and that was a show unapologetically about *one man deliberately disregarding orders for the greater good* with discovery theyre trying to make michael burnham the center of everything in the *universe* it was already ridiculous before the season began but this year theyve tossed any and all common sense out the window and doubled down on their choice to make the show all about her which would be fine if the writing could make that happen organically which would be fine if she was a character worthy of that kind of gravitas but its not and shes not shes the weakest character on the show but then we get that line about her being cut out for the captains chair saru the most professional character with the most intriguing story -- hes not hes inevitably going to be forced out so that michael burnham the least professional and least interesting character on the show can replace him for the record: i dont hate burnhams character i just hate that the show is centered around her and that the plot is written around that it doesnt fit it doesnt make sense its not interesting its not fun its not star trek,lifelong star trek fan with valid criticisms of discovery
2099,startrek,when we see him fighting  we rarely see him use his abilities he should be like the liquid terminator but instead he does the old double-hand to the backtheres a few notable exceptions like in the premier when he dodges a mace or in the alternate when he is infected with another lifeform i just wish it was shown better,odos abiliies were poorly represented
2100,startrek,how would it be created since the original kelvin timeline was made by spock so it is possible that the mirror universe spock did the same thing i would love to see this in the movies,does the kelvin timeline have a mirror universe of its own
2101,startrek,*i’m not crying you’re crying*but really it’s hard to imagine any other early episode with such an emotional quality to it this time around i found myself viewing this episode with a whole new nuance after going through 2020 the struggles of humankind altruism what kind of a world we want to create and live in the idea of equality and freedomall these themes pulling at every part of who we areeverything we endured last year made starting my new year off with this episode so much more visceral and real if only we could have such clarity every day of our livesof what truly matters here’s to the new year everyone let’s fight to make it a good one,just finished rewatching “the measure of a man” to start my 2021
2102,startrek,this really ticks me off  on the subject of transporters:by this point in the future youd think transporter blocking technology would be a done deal would not be hard to implement and come with its own iff system so that only authorized transports happen the kind of thing i was thinking of any non authorized transports would either be blocked or sent into the void depending on threat level,why are transporter blockers not a thing
2103,startrek,could we find a way to crowdfund a hd remaster of ds9 or voyager,crowdfunding ds9 &amp; voyager
2104,startrek,suggesting about zora and future content:they need to purge the emerald chain os from discovery systems but with no time left i bet zora volunteers to backup and takeover the discovery systems so after this episode we have now official the birth of zora the ships computer sentinel ai where sensors are her eyes and ears inside and outside reminds me a bit of homeworld 2 the pc-game perhaps zora is allowed to create an own programmable matter or hologram body on her own and if they want to keep the discovery crew family together its an copy of airiam that undergo the same procedure as 7of9 turned into human and perhaps a well known discovery mhd could make an cameo to self teaching her like he is the teacher and she the student imagine an classroom with voyagers timeline uniforms sitting in an buster keaton classroom to become more human well if they play it right then zora could be the spirit successor of data in want to become more human and jet reno could take over as teacher and would make an good excuse to have less screen time discovery could get an extra security tight computer core just for herbut how would burnham react to airiams body and the commander that purged her into space ptsd,discovery s3 about future content spoilers
2105,startrek,please forgive mobile if my paragraph breaks dont come throughi had planned on watching year of hell over midnight to end 2020 but i wound up with an hd copy of bobw insteadthrough the quarantine ive been enjoying taking screenshots of special effects and model shots from the laptop a new source of wallpapers and keeps my photo editing and eye sharpi noticed in some scenes specifically now the enterprise warping away as the borg cube explodes that the motion lines and blur in a paused screen advancing frame by frame tend to show up in advance of the rest of the object movingis there something i dont know about how digital screen grabs work when the source material is on pause or could it be that motion blur shows up in shots that were done backwards during production and played back forwards and recomposited afterwards in the final projecti suppose with cg stuff like that no longer happens maybe but their model work is wonderful and seems more real to me,motion blur in still shots re: model shooting
2106,startrek,what got me thinking about this is a scene from tng troy asks the computer to replicate her a real chocolate sunday but the computer says that its not within dietary guidelines implying that it can be done however in ds9 theyre saying that replicators dont make real food at all are there any other things that were better before a later series made them bad and with all of these retcons in mind which version of star trek is the most advanced a way to think about it is if all of them happened in separate canons which one would seem the most advanced on its own,which iteration of star trek had the most advanced tech before retcons
2107,startrek,this way should someone die during the mission their most recent pattern captured at the time of departure could be rematerialized along with the other crew members when they beam up as if nothing happened though the resurrected crew member would of course remember nothing of the mission only up to the point when they were dematerialized  yes patterns degrade while in the pattern buffer but how quickly i could bring up the episode when scotty used a transporter for stasis purposes but that is held to have been a special circumstance the other guy he tried to save didnt make it this one time his pattern remained stable for multiple decades but because it was a fluke we cant consider it representative  there is however a ds9 episode wherein the crew of an exploding spacecraft are rescued via transporter at the last possible moment but cannot be rematerialized right away the entire stations memory is cleared so their patterns can be stored nine people if i recall correctly their patterns remained in storage fora few days i think   this furnishes a more representative example because it wasnt a specially rigged setup by miracle worker scotty but a quickly improvised solution using standard transporter tech available on the station we have no reason to believe obrien did anything special with the ds9 transporters in this situation which couldnt be replicated unlike scottys stasis feat   that establishes that patterns can be kept in the buffer long enough for the typical away mission and then some without fatal degradation occurring we know there exists sufficient memory onboard starships for as many patterns as they have transporter pads as in order to transport that many people simultaneously they need sufficient memory to keep that many patterns in the buffer during transport  so why isnt this standard practice away missions are risky endeavors should someone die during the mission theres no good reason even given in-universe constraints on transporter technology why their death should be permanent,there is no in-universe reason why transporters couldnt keep a backup of away team members in case of death
2108,startrek,the writers seem to have tried to make season 3 better but i feel it could improve on a certain thingsbefore an action scene is where character development seems to happen and is extremely predictable the conversations always seem to be in the lines of  i may or may not come back so lets bond im pretty sure after going through what they did they are pretty used to it like the scene where they were trying to investigate the source of burn at the verubin nebula its almost like exploration and didnt need the excessively dramatic conversations before they ventured out from the recent episode we discover osyraa speaks about the good side of her and it happens just one episode before the finale which isnt good its almost like they were still writing the character after the shooting beganthe story still moves through the eyes of burnham which makes it lack the flow this show badly needs maybe half an episode dedicated to explaining the orion syndicate and how they came to what they are talking about the scientist guy aurelio and his accomplishments would have made it much smoother and would have made this show even better,dis s03 is better than the previous seasons but it lacks the flow
2109,startrek,,a new vintage - a star trek: lower decks s1 review
2110,startrek,i know their original schtick was supposed to be 20th century americans and greed and they evolved into more than that as they got fleshed out but all i can see when i look at ferengi are jewish stereotypes disclaimer: im not anti-semitic nor do i consider the ferengi problematic i think theyre a fine addition to st canon but they just remind me so much of those anti-semitic comic/cartoons that edgy sites like 4chan circulatehow do you feel about them,how do you feel about the ferengi
2111,startrek,background: i only started discovery this year lifelong trekkie it’s my go-to show when stressed or anxious at night etc have gone to the convention here in vegas multiple times love it all i just resisted discovery because of the while all access thing and some of the spoilers i’ve heard over the years didn’t really interest methat said here’s my unoriginal take: michael burnham has turned in to a terrible main character and discovery is suffering as a result mid-season 3 it got so bad i almost quit the show still might am i alone in this thoughtseason 1: klingons aside i dug first season michael i dig everything from lighting to the ‘twist’ all that i even pressed the ‘i believe’ button on spock’s secret sister storyline in hindsight it wasn’t necessary but it made for compelling episodes so it worksseason 2: klingons corrected complete tone shift michael means more to spock spock is insane but also saves time and space show runners boot discovery to the future with an excellent tie in with a michael’s mom and her upbringing solid stuff georgiou is loved but not exactly believable for me in most of the situations she’s in  they finally started building the other characters a la every other trek show  i’m excited for season 3 michael hangs with her mom maybe we’ll seeseason 3: the future ‘fresh trek’ saru is a boss he should have his own show but  why is michael always breaking rules but allowed to continue serving starfleet in any commanding rank her reckoning is to be  from xo but still finds herself at most of the important decision making meetings why is every other line whispered why does she come and go as she pleases and why is it always her to fix the issue she is never wrong and when she is somehow gets validated anyway don’t get me started on somehow whisper-debating her way through several hundred years of romulan-vulcan politics in an afternoon and somehow being the only person who thought about checking the black boxes doesn’t the chain have some pretty clever folk don’t get me started on plot-device-monk mom the sisterhood of traveling candor felt that comfortable with such a new acolyte that they’d send her own mother to be micheal’s second that whole episode wreaked of hamfisting a narrative just to keep michael as the plot engineseason 3 seems to be star trek: micheal burnham episode 3 is where i started to notice season 1 and 2 were always michael focused bit their plots kinda dictated it season 3 has a more ‘global’ plot and for some reason the writers of discovery are doing everything they can to make michael an episode-to-episode lynchpin with far too much melodrama,discovery: my michael burnham take spoilers

2119,startrek,one of kirks top traits is skill as a military tactician he quickly and clearly sees his enemies’ weakness and how to exploit it  for example in the episode “the balance of terror” kirk quickly picks up that the romulan bird of prey decloaks before it fires because it has to  according to the romulan commander it was like kirk was a sorcerer who lived in his mind another great examples is “charlie x” in that episode kirk realizes the powerful charlie evans often makes people disappear when he’s angry with them however he also notices that charlie stops doing this when he takes over the ship  kirk concludes correctly as it turns out that charlie’s power is limited in that if he activates all his ship’s systems he may be able to overload him  kirk defeats charlie just in time for the thasians to pick him up even when he was over-powered in the corbomite maneuver  he was able to outsmart his opponent by bluffing and does it again in his next encounter with the romulans   kirk also shows of his skill taking the most sophisticated ais into killing themselves and despite his intelligence mr spock often loses at chess to captain kirk    however with trelane all his skills seem to mislead him  kirk notices that trelane likes the mirror and he concludes reasonably that the mirror is the source of his power  when he destroys it kirk thinks he has won but doesnt realize that he has miscalculated until he tires to turn his ship around and sees gothos facing him again    as picard says in the next century  it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose that is not a weakness; that is lifeit is worth noting that every time trelane meets kirk on even grounds kirk knocks him on his butt however the boy god just falls back each time on his power  finally he grows board and corners kirk and the only thing that saves our dear captain is the arrival of trelanes parentsif you want to read my review of the squire of gothos you can do so here: ,the squire of gothos: kirks only real defeat
2120,startrek,i feel like the picard tie in move was a much more “star trek” tale and way better take on “what came next” for picard in a way that was compelling and tied in with the jj verse enough that you could have brought eric baja’s character back,picard tie-in novel: anyone else wish this was the show we got
2121,startrek,osyraa could easily be a ferengi she talks of capitalism and deals in trade,orions are just ferengis who are taken seriously
2122,startrek,if you havent seen andromeda you should its pretty good  but basically an interstellar alliance that spans three galaxies falls due to a civil war  and the captain of the most advanced warship in the fleet tries to rebuild it  sound familar  because it should  its kind of the plot for discovery season three  after the burn the federation is in ruins  and only a few dozen member worlds remain  planets like earth and vulcan are no longer part of the federation  civilization has been replaced with chaos  so as much as season three is an improvement over seasons one and two its a rip off of andromeda,discovery season three is a rip off of andromeda

2129,startrek,this is something that has bothered me all season randomly some characters necks appear to be blurred it was very evident this episode with osyrra for example whats worse is it doesnt appear in every scene whats nuts is they have such good space battles and yet they literally just add a blur filter from their editing software to hide whatever the hell theyre hiding it slipped a few times this episode and it didnt look like there was anything odd with osyrras neck very confusingimage example: ,has anyone else noticed the really bad neck cgi in discovery

2140,startrek,with osyraa revealing the emerald chain deals with pockets of the federation cut off from the legitimate government and revealing her desire for not only the spore tech of discovery but the name and reputation of the federation itself i got to thinking and i theorize that many of these pockets of the federation have already been merged with the emerald chain if not flat out conquered and have abandoned their morals and codes the same way captain ransom does on the equinox in voy  and that osyraa might try to fake the accord using a fake vance like sela did with spock in the tng episode unification  part 2 and use the separated pieces and salvaged resources of the pre burn federation she has to falsely claim the chain has merged with the federation leading to a civil war to determine which federation is the legitimate governing bodythe episode live fast and prosper from voy also comes to mind   a group of con artists masquerade as janeway chakotay and tuvok to abuse the reputation voyager and the federation has established in the region to scam desperate worlds of precious resourcesit feels like the emerald chain wants to use the federation as a layer of sheeps clothing to hide their wolf like reputation and behavior use the name and reputation of the federation to get what they want from the rest of the galaxy with little/no resistance because everyone helps the benevolent federation but revert back to the cruel and barbaric methods of the chain down the road with the benefit of saying but we are the federation so our atrocities are actually morally and ethically justified since we establish what morals are in the galaxythats just where i feel like this is heading and itd be interesting to see because everyone loved starfleet ships shooting other starfleet ships,potential direction for season 4 disco inspired by tng &amp; voyager *spoilers*

2162,startrek,i have always heard people praising tng and ds9 and saying voy is not that good after watching the incredible finale of ds9 i was a bit reluctant of starting voy and not get a show that was not that good i thought about taking a break from star trek to go watch other stuff for some months but the thrill of watching a whole new trek show was exciting enough to make me start voy nonethelessand i am so glad i did the pilot episode already showed me that there was good enough stuff to go on and that janeway actually is a fantastic captain too early to say for sure but possibly the best captain so far the second episode with the whole janeway and belanna dynamic was incredible and i thought it was a fantastic episode the third and fourth episodes actually made me love kes neelix and the doctor with all their quirks and unique personalities the scene in which the doctor slaps paris is probably the trek scene that made me laugh the most i really had to pause the episode to keep laughing,4 episodes of voyager in im already in love with kes neelix and the doctor
2163,startrek,i made these 3d models of star trek tng characters in the form of pop vinyls in blender hope you like them as much as i do :d picture 01picture 02,fan art of star trek tng pop vinyls
2164,startrek,seeing as i cannot upload images i sure hope this is acceptable if not i can accept punishments picture 01picture 02,fan art of star trek tng pop vinyls
2165,startrek,sooooooam i the first to notice that later in the remake movies spock is in love with uhura who also happens to be a lot like michael both physically and personality while not wholey personality wise they share the same stubborn headedness and deep compassion and love for others could it be that spock is attempting to regain his long lost sister thru uhura 😳😳,freud and spock
2166,startrek,,how james doohans ashes wound up on the international space station
2167,startrek,if picard didnt change the future at the end of all good things then data would never have died,picard killed data
2168,startrek,,i keep picturing this scene in my head as 2020 comes to an end
2169,startrek,the question and discussion is significantly centered around tos and tng because ive noticed this very often here its things like making only left or right turns it generally engaging enemies without considering elevation tactics there are famous exceptions of course in both the tv shows and movies also most of the coordinates they use are 2d for instance in tng s2e3 elementary dear data we hear in the captains log about the coordinates and theyre obviously 2d in nature like we would locate or identify places down here on earthof course the ready room discussions indicate otherwise but mostly their depictions are 2d in nature idk if im understanding wrong or if this is indeed the case,does it bother anybody else that everything is perceived in 2d most of the time
2170,startrek,smoke alarm goes off and whoosh into the vacuum of space you gofilthy habit anyway,i bet nobody smokes in the bathrooms on discovery
2171,startrek,,if star trek is considered utopian isnt that dystopian though it appears to be extreme left wing which is no different than right wing ideology which is to free people from their suffering and that has been every fascist dream
2172,startrek,spoilers if you havent seen the recent episode of discovery  i think vance is a terrible diplomat  osyraa offered him peace and he wanted to put her on trial  of course she is guilty of horrible crimes  but peace should be the goal at the moment  worry about osyraa later  wanting to put her on trail is like wanting to put the klingon chanceller on trial just before the kitimer accords were signed  its dumb  let me know what you think,someone is a terrible diplomat
2173,startrek,,the most risk-averse people are the most likely to get their groceries home-delivered and the least risk-averse and therefore those least likely to wear a mask properly etc make up most of the people in the supermarket thus helping covid to spread quicker
2174,startrek,what if with some shushing and hand-waving the disco because of its spore drive is left in that nebula from calypsowe saw last week how hazardous is it in a galaxy without dilithium and we know how hazardous it is in a galaxy *with* it from s1maybe for season 4 they get a fancy new 31st century ship the first new one with a dilithium-based warp drive in a century the uss *discovery* ncc-1031-b with new uniforms and allfrom a production standpoint it would also free up the discovery’s corridors and sets to be transferred over to snw to be repainted and revamped to be the *enterprise*’s corridors and sets as well as freeing up the uniforms for use on snw guest cast for when shooting starts early next near,a thought as we head towards dsc’s finale
2175,startrek,i just finished there is a tide and i found the entire sequence with vance/osyraa fascinating and im not at all convinced the admiral made the correct decisionby the admirals own admission the ceasefire is an amazing treaty short of his one request well get to that we know it ends slavery on countless worlds and starts a 15 year plan to abandon 50 exploited pre-warp civilizations a plan likely covered in that treaty he read as osyraa rightly pointed out anything faster would be chaos you cant just create a power vacuum overnight like thatwe also learned that osyraa isnt the dictator of the emerald chain she made reference to a parliament/congress cant remember the word she used which actually passed laws and needed enough support to do so suggesting a semi-large and diverse legal body yes osyraa has done horrible things but she is not her government i would lake to take a moment now to point out the democracies of the world mine included which have spent the past few years enjoying a less-then-idyllic leaders now tell me this makes the entire emerald chain that just voted out slavery evilthe episode discussion thread is understandably spare right now at 12:30pm pst but i am amazed at the number of well obviously osyraa was fooling the lye-detector somehow comments even without the above legal stuff can we as a fandom really praise the ideals of the federation so highly yet not even entertain the idea that osyraa wants this to work she may be machiavellian in her methods but she is still a leader so i am going to accept the fact that the lie detector wasnt faulty and everything osyraa said was true admiral vance believed it and he knows a lot more about the chain then we doso taking all that into account i dont think insisting on persecuting osyraa at the cost of the entire treaty is the right decision especcially not when made unilaterally by the admiral rather then the federation civilian government which may i remind you is located in the same station as starfleet in fact i think osyraa may have even been persecuted anyways in time as the chain slowly liberalizedthe galaxy is incredibly destabilized at the moment the federation has the dylithium supply and a spore drive and dozens of planets and outposts with zero infrastructure meanwhile the chain has is primarily a currier service with the scientific ability to turn that spore drive into a blueprint but no dylithium both sides have what the other needs yes the chain has slavery and oppresses 50 primitive worlds but it is one federation signature from ending slavery for thousands if not millions and freeing those worlds that alone is a stabilizing force but the end of hostilities between the two major powers is even bigger the distribution of dylithium and eventual spore drive technology is enough to get the galaxy back on trackso admiral vance if allowing one villan who is now extending the hand of peace to go free goes against federation principles widespread slavery the oppression of 50 worlds and an open state of conflict then im sorry the neighboring nation has a bad egg now tell me the klingons never did in tng or the romulans during the dominion war heck show me one decade just one where a high ranking starfleet officer didnt go against federation idealsat the very least peace was worth a chance,was the right decision made in the latest episode
2176,startrek,the cage wasn’t aired so isn’t included but if it is last weeks was the 800th either way a fantastic landmark,this weeks episode of discovery marks the 800th episode of star trek aired on tv
2177,startrek,the cage wasn’t aired so isn’t included but if it is last weeks was the 800th either way a fantastic landmark,this weeks episode of discovery marks the 800th episode of star trek aired in tv
2178,startrek,i think if voyager had been made in the past ten years then this is what it would have been like1 the maquis would have mutinied and tried to take over the ship by the end of the first season  2 voyager would get into fire fights in almost every episode but not have repaired the damage by the next episode  the ship would be falling apart like in year of hell  3 the crew would have to become sociopaths to survive the delta quadrant  mutiny would become common  and it would be more like the terran empire where officers advance in rank by killing those who outrank them 4 if janeway and chakotay were killed and tuvok had to take over as captain god help him  a lot of the crew doesnt like him and he would be fending off attempted mutinies on an almost daily basis  5 janeway would execute more people  especially mutineers   janeway would reluctantly have to torture aliens in arilocks like archer did6 q would interact with the crew of voyager and realize they have become a group of barbarians  and put them on trial  7 neelix would be thrown out the airlock because everyone hates his cooking8 janeway would have a total mental breakdown when she realizes what a hell hole the delta quadrant is  and that she should have gotten her crew home by any means necessaryanyway these are just a few things that i think would be different if voyager was a modern show  let me know what you think in the comments,what if voyager was a modern show

2180,startrek,i was a star wars fan from childhood but was always intimidated by star trek there were so many shows and seasons that i was just flat out scared to touch it it seemed like such a commitment well some people in my dnd group wanted to do a remote session that is star trek themed of course i still want to play some form of dnd until we can meet again in person so i said i would join now of course i have to do research to get into the role play the dm gave us a bare bones episode guide to watch from every series to understand the relevant lore but whoops i just started watching every episode of tos and tng i’m halfway through season 2 of tng and anticipate catching up to all of the seasons and series by march at this rate my favorite character is spock i know how original and i’m sad there isn’t much vulcan representation after tos,i’ve never watched star trek in my 25 years on this planet and i’m so happy i started
2181,startrek,,could this fanmade mashup between animated star trek and audio of truck turners dorinda be mirror universe uhura both are played by nichelle nichols who played uhura and went in real hard as madame dorinda in the 1974 movie truck turner
2182,startrek,i saw a forum about the nebula and galaxy class being interchangeable with their saucer modules given as to how similar they are in design could a galaxy class saucer module be interchanged with a nebula class star drive it seems like they would be interchangeable or would the size of the saucers and clamping mechanisms that hold the saucer module to the star drive be different between the 2 classes,nebula class and galaxy class cross capability
2183,startrek,this is something i been wanting to do forever just rewatch the entire franchise from start to finish the problem is im just too lazy to do it lol and to be fair i watch tons of trek all year as it is and the last two years has been tons of it since they announced the picard show watching tons of tng and the other shows; including a complete rewatch of ds9 last year when the documentary was coming out i probably seen at least 200 hours of classic star trek in the last two years alone none of that counts all the new shows like dis pic and lds so ill be rewatching everything i seeni decided to do it in chronological order because its just more fun that way so i will be going from the 22nd to the 32nd century woo-hoo and this is the order i will mostly watch it in:1 enterprise2 discovery seasons 1-23 the original series4 the animated series will be my first time ever watching this btw5 the original series movies tmo-tuc6 the next generation 7 deep space nine seasons 1-38 generations9 voyagerseason 1-210 deep space nine season 411 first contact12 voyager season 3-413 deep space nine season 514 insurrection15 deep space nine season 6-716 voyager season 5-717 nemesis18 lower decks19 the kelvin movies20 picard21 discovery season 3and maybe 4damn thats a lot of star trek lol now ive given myself until september 8th to finish but its not some hard and fast rule im just going to watch as much as i can whenever i can or have the urge to but hopefully ill finish it all in the year the latest the only real rule is to watch every show and movie in order and not skip anything yes even spocks brain and threshold ;and lets be honest once discovery is done next week there probably wont be any new trek on until late summer/early fall at best so perfect time for itthe human adventure beginswish me luck the first viewing is broken bow on january 1st at midnight,my new years resolution for 2021: watch every episode and movie of star trek in chronological order hope to finish in time by its 55th anniversary on september 8th
2184,startrek,just got the idea of quantum dream detroit become human beyond 2 souls or someone like them making a star trek game that takes entirely on a star ship maybe not one as large as the enterprise but definitely a smaller ship with perhaps 75 crew members the world should be extremely detailed think skyrim level of detail but scaled down to a ship every crew member should have his or her own quarters with his or her own background and personal decorations with a story in their quarters every crew member has their own schedule and jobs like in oblivion butbetterevery crew member should have their own side mission and you should be able to keep track of crew members like you could keep track of character schedules in zelda majoras maskeveryone has interactions with everyone and they especially have interations with you like mass effect or tell tale gamescan be either 3rd person or 1st person but im thinking first person would be betteryou play as first officer you make sure everything on the ship is running accordingly engineering security science medical bay etc all answer to you but its your job to make sure they have everything they need to function properly this is the sim portion of the gamehow well everyone functions will dictate how well your battles go you will have ship to ship battles although political and diplomatic methods are preferred imagine wanting to have a peaceful resolution with the klingons or romulans and a peaceful resolution is possible; however a choice you made earlier in the game makes it impossible and as such you get into a battle if you have done your job properly and engineering/security/medical etc all function properly you do well in the fight if you sucked and as such your crew sucks well you take heavy damage and in fire emblem like fashion characters actually die so you may have spent 10 whole hours trying to romance ensign lira lwaxanton and boom she was lost in a hull breach her body lost to the vacuum of spaceyou can have away missions and they can be small load outs like planet missions in mass effect 1 onlybetteryou can choose your away mission crew you think its a good chance for ensign timmy pascal to earn his promotion the mission is going well and you can tell ensign pascal is trying his earnest not to let you down you cant help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for your crewman youre definitely going to put in for his promotionthen boom he gets tasha yard bc you didnt choose your away team appropriately like the suicide mission in mass effect 2away mission combat would be ripped directly from xcom ship to ship battle would be essentially the game star trek bridge creweverything else would be tell tale/mass effect/quantum dream/majoras mask/fire emblem choice makingand last but not least: holodeck in addition to side missions specifically designed to be trippy like most holodeck episodes you can also just straight-up use the holodeck to grind individual crew members for away missions think mememtos from persona 5,star trek game developed by quantum dream dream game
2185,startrek,i saw the first episode of a new online spin off early in 2020  at the time only one episode existed with more to come but i have not been able to find any more  i dont know the name of this series  in the opening episode the hero is approaching earth trying to rescue a craft crewed by a scientist and her daughter that is burning up in the atmosphere    later robert picardo repairs an android damaged on a mining planet   the android now has free will and winds up on mars in aid of a rebellion    does anyone know the name of episode and series and are there any more episodes,looking for a newish star trek spin off
2186,startrek,i am sure you dont keep something like that private the kelvin romulans will be investigating the hell out of any names they get but what about unificationdid they open up to or perhaps kidnap vulcans why did spock say there were so few of us left when romulus and many colony worlds of green blooded goblins exist in the prime universe they wouldnt have met the romulans via image just yet; are they so secretive in the kelvin or maybe celebrating the final destruction of those who ran them off of their homeworld,how do you think the kelvin universes romulans reacted to vulcan being destroyed
2187,startrek,after scrounging the internet it seems like the general consensus from die-hard star trek fans is that discovery is not very well liked but please bear with me its the first star trek aside from the modern movies ive seen and i loved it and i want to watch more ive considered the chronological order or recommended order to watch the star trek universe but it seems the order comes from people whove seen the original series or at least started from the older series im currently watching enterprise its a bit slow but seems familiar compared to discovery but well see how it goesim curious to know if there are others who started on discovery and where did you go after that,binge watched discovery and loved it whats next
2188,startrek,im kind of new to the online fandom despite watching on and off for years what are the major online communities in trek-domno facebook groups please dont have one,what other star trek forums exist
2189,startrek,instead of riker lwaxanna gets q powers,a terrifying thought:
2190,startrek,when it was originally on i would watch episodes in the first season but i never really got into it that much i loved star trek deep space nine far more and i kinda just quit watching voyager at some point  but now with it on multiple streaming sites i started watching it more on netflix and later cbs all access i quite enjoy it now  i have found it to be pretty fun over all  at the time it was originally on i just kept comparing it to ds9 and tng and now i just can appreciate it as its own thing more,i have come to enjoy star trek voyager more than i have in the past
2191,startrek,the eugenics wars were a very big deal in the past history of treks universe one consequence was that humanity decided to embark upon a future that was anti-transhumanist humans would explore space for enlightenment rather than becoming post-humans i almost suspect the federation itself would have some anti-eugenics feature in its constitutionthat said the rejection of genetic engineering and transhumanism was in a context in which eugenics was embraced broadly beforehand hints from trek and my sense of roddenberrys attitudes makes me think that there was eugenics in trekthat is trek features liberal eugenics this is where all eugenics is done individually and not institutionally and it is done in the context of a human relationship producing a child out of loveyou would have a fence of law built around eugenics but within that fence technology would be applied to the absolute limit first of all picking the best fruit - where a womans eggs and a mans sperm are harvested and surveyed and the man and woman can choose which combination of their own genes is preferredsecond mate selection based on genetic profilesthird epigenetic management engineering everything except for the genesfourth things like best practices for nutrition and child development to unlock the full potential of a persons genetic baselinewhen people date theyd check genetic profiles as casually as people today talk about whether they want to raise kids in the city or the country a person who loves music might want to find a gifted musician to have kids withbut this is all liberalized so nothing is force there are no rules to it and you can do ultimately what you want however there is effectively a eugenic program in the societymy evidence for this - and its more of a roddenberry conceit - is that season 1 episode with the child who has calculus homeworkclearly roddenberry is implying a few things by this educational methods will be that good in the future half of why mankind is more mature maybe starfleet are the best of the best so smart even their kids are natural geniuseshowever i think - given roddenberrys very casual and open attitudes about sexual liberalization and how we should shed certain inhibitions and the idea of techno-progressivism - that roddenberry is implying that people themselves are smarter and better in the future that this isnt transhumanist which they back then called eugenics but rather natural which is implicitly eugenecistanyway i like to sometimes think about the elements of the future in trek that we take for granted like no money and how it might work a lot differently than we think after all if we knew how it worked wed do it already the whole point is theyve figured some things out that we havent thats why its the futureeven so the question of liberal eugenics is interested once cultural stigmas wane theres no reason not to do it on the other hand eugenics is a concession that some kinds of children are more valuable than other kinds that will play in poorly to social divisions and structural inequitieswe arent mature enough yet to engage in eugenics with a liberal spirit well use it to embed our imperfections in this sense eugenics is paradoxical its the quest for a more perfect version of our imperfect selves,eugenics wars - i think there are still eugenics in the future
2192,startrek,so of course i had to choose one of those scenes when doing a quick painting study one has to wonder when theyre just going to give up and hand him a paper bag with holes cut out for eyes,i think my favorite thing about tos is the amount of ways they attempt to disguise spock on earth-like worlds
2193,startrek,,which dax is better jadxia or ezri
2194,startrek,if the vidiian borg q and dominion fought who would win,who would win
2195,startrek,,props to the ds9 writers 20 years after the show ended people still remember kai winn as one of the most despicable fictional characters ever written
2196,startrek,almost didn’t decorate for the holidays this year but we managed to get a tree and put some lights and ornaments up we’ve collected most of the ornaments that plug into string of lights but the shuttlecraft and borg cube are our favorites because of their respective holiday greetings here they are in action,hanging these has been a family tradition for years thought i’d share only put two up for 2020 but they’re our favorite
2197,startrek,,why james bonds studio once sent a very stern letter to star trek: deep space nines crew
2198,startrek,just finished star trek enterprise and i don’t know what to think only 4 seasons so i didn’t get that attached to the characters and it almost felt like at every turn there was spoilers as most of it is laying the foundation for tos and tng yes i know that’s how prequels work they could have executed every single confrontation so differently and the crew chose the weirdest way even navy captains from today could have told you that half the situations they get into are either traps or the people have an underlying motive,opinions on star trek: enterprise
2199,startrek,i love tng its my comfort show its so perfect to me that i havent been able to get into any other trek series the same way to me the virtues of tng are what make it so special and capt picard is often the embodiment of those virtues does the new series maintain that original spirit will it taint his image for me or does it do the picard of 25 years ago justicethanks,im nervous picard could spoil his image from tng for me should i watch it
2200,startrek,i was just watching the voyager ep ashes to ashes a child sculpting a cube out of clay says it is precisely one one thousandth the size of a borg vesselthe kid could easily pick up that cube in one hand so if its more than six inches per side im a pangolin seven of nines all cool good work and the whole subplot of the episode is her being hard on these poppets so the ratio obviously sounds fine to her that makes your standard borg cube around 500 feet per side or half the length of the refit ncc-1701 not so intimidating now huh,borg cubes are canonically small
2201,startrek,the non-canonical tie-in novels sometimes make their way through to the show in less direct ways am i correct in my impression that the rihannsu novels at least introduced the idea that romulans have swords which made it through to the 2009 film and obviously *star trek: picard*,the influence of diane duanes rihannsu novels on canonical depictions of the romulans
2202,startrek,ive only recently started watching trek and an currently going through ds9 something ive always been confused about is how the starfleet crew part quarkam i correct that the officers dont get paid by starfleet from what i know the federation has moved past money so to speak so do they just all have a community vault of latinum they all grab some strips from to give to quark as needed,ds9 - how do starfleet members pay at quarks
2203,startrek,,which are your all time favourite episodes from any star trek series
2204,startrek, the first of her name queen of the andals the rhoynar and the first men lady of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm lady of dragonstone queen of meereen khaleesi of the great grass sea the unburnt breaker of chains and mother of dragons who are you,i am lwaxana troi daughter of the fifth house of betazed holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed
2205,startrek,in season 2 episode 7 obrien uses dna sample to transport the doctor back from the surface and correct her dna along with her aging and other issues how does this never happen again with people being transported to medical emergency or virus or anything else its shown to not only reverse her aging but also heal her and keep her memories in place with it  why dont they use this when transporting mortally wounded crew members riker getting a virus in the brain and any other issues that they can correct with the dna or transport logs on file,why was the transporter healing abilities never brought up again in star trek next generation
2206,startrek,in far beyond the stars human martok drew this really cool retrofuturistic take on ds9i wanted to recreate it in beautiful 3d so here it is,i decided to recreate the ds9 from far beyond the stars
2207,startrek,i was recently watching ds9 and noticed that odos uniform lacks a collar where in others the rank insignia usually is then i realized i dont think ive ever heard odos rank we know his position is security chief but thats a position not a rank constable is said to have been a sort of nickname kira gave him when they first met does he have an official rank,what is odos rank
2208,startrek,are there any quiet doors in star trek i was watching an episode of ds9 and realized even the doors between rooms within a familys quarters make the same loud sound when opening and closing is there  way for someone to get up and use the bathroom in the middle of the night without waking everyone else up,doors
2209,startrek,would they be then able to create an infinite army of hologram borg each with their own emitter would that forever solve their reproduction issue,what would happen if the borg captured voyager and assimilated the doctor
2210,startrek,so somebody just posted obrians exit from the enterprise d and i wondered what your favorite departure scene of a regular character was,best final scene of a regular character not death
2211,startrek,she was a bartender yet the computer normally makes drinks so why did they need to hire someone just to be a bartender downvote me if you want but i’m asking sincerely,guinan: the most useless character on tng
2212,startrek,there have been times in which star fleet captains have intentionally harmed innocent people because of the greater good that would result as because of those sections sisko archer but in scorpion janeway assists the borg to save her crew at the cost of trillions of lives even if you take the perspective that species 8472 were a danger to the delta quadrant the technology they provided would undoubtedly be shared with other borg cubes and used to assimilate innocent species across the milky wayand possibly beyond we could empathize with sisko and archer because their actions in”in the pale moonlight” and”damage” contributed to the greater good janeway’s actions contributed to a worse outcome for the galaxy at large what’s your opinion do you agree or do you have a different perspective,captain janeway’s actions in scorpion
2213,startrek,,doug jones interview part 2
2214,startrek,im posting here in hopes for some feedback: i havent found an official style guide to lcars so ive tried to go off of stills from episodes and things others have made but im still not loving this this was made using klwp and based off a theme created by another redditor,my lcars android theme
2215,startrek,i found this awesome picture on etsy a while back and someone got it for me for christmas it’s fantastic and i’d definitely recommend it my enterprise display: ,my enterprise display got a new piece of artwork for christmas
2216,startrek,in the documentary the voyage home gillian jumps into kirks transporter stream at the last second would the transporter or mr scott be able to instantly determine how many people are being beamed into the ship thus preventing both people being merged into one,transporter question
2217,startrek,  now one of the things that annoy most fans of a franchise as long running as the trekverse is the continuity errors and the change in tone of each show – in this same reddit and almost every place where fans congregate you can find declarations that ds9/voy/dis/ent/whatever “just isn’t real trek” me for instance loved ds9 for its plot and writing but don’t want to imagine federation’s dark sides said dark sides shot upto eleven during picard so much that i quit watching that one one possible explanation – parallel universeswe saw in parallels that thousands of universes with much the same individuals exist at the same time with their own differences based on individual choices each show and each movie series  is from a different parallel universe – each universe has/had a kirk/picard/janeway and their teams but each universe also has subtle differences different choices  the tos universe is not the same as tng one the ds9 universe is not the same as the voy one the movies are not set in the same universe as the shows and so onso in one universe federation remained the knight in shining armor in another it took a level in jerkass in one universe data lived long enough to be an admiral in another he died in nemesis in one universe picard was disillusioned and broken in another he is still with the more or less idealist federation and so onthat at least is my headcanon mostly fueled by a need to undo the depression from  watching the kelvinverse films and picard back to back – okay it happened but it didn’t happen to the spock and picard i fell in love with sigh… i am taking this a bit too seriously,parallel universes – or how to explain continuity errors
2218,startrek,,2020 as told by star trek via 
2219,startrek,star trek iv is one of my favorite movies ever with a beautiful humanistic message so i wanted to capture my favorite moment from that movie with my first attempt at building a diorama included is a picture right before the bird of prey decloaks and the novelization of star trek v: the final frontier for scaleadmiral there be whales here ,1/1000 hms bounty and custom humpback whale base
2220,startrek,once more with feeling was arguably buffy the vampire slayers finest hour managing to use the conventions of musical theater to simultaneously advance the story give us a window into the characters inner lives and just have a ton of fun buffy due to its concept and tone was uniquely positioned to make a musical episode work other attempts like scrubs were a lot less successful star trek has never been simultaneously campy and self-aware enough to pull off a musical even though they deal with just as much weird as buffy and could easily enough find a premise even if was just a bored q enter lower decks it takes itself less seriously than other treks and can do things other treks would never attempt eugene cordero and tawny newsome are both incredibly talented singers see their episodes of off book: the improvised musical if you have any doubt also one of the hosts of that show jess mckenna plays ensign barnes and the cerritos computer they could get a big name star with singing chops to play the q who sets this all in motion  this is our best chance at a trek musical just give us this mike mcmahan im begging you,lower decks could totally pull off a musical episode
2221,startrek,,star trek: john de lancie announces qs return in cameo message
2222,startrek,the past couple years ive been working on getting autographs from all of the tng bridge crew but then covid hit and in person cons went away for the time being does anyone know if sir patrick does mail-in autographs,autograph question
2223,startrek,the coloration of mucus membranes come from blood vessels to my knowledge so since vulcan blood is green they should be for that matter shouldnt they blush green,shouldnt vulcans have green tongues
2224,startrek,i was wondering if anyone thought of the possibility of the doctors sentience being transferred into a golum like picard would that be beneficial to him so many forms of sentience in star trek it amazes meor an upgraded holo emitter that stays inside his body so nobody can steal it it would emit a stronger force field / sheilding,the doctor ai as a golum
2225,startrek,,one of my favorite quotes out of all the series imho nothing rings more true and of course it was said by bones
2226,startrek,does the tos ship actually ever been shown going into warp or do they not show that until the movies,tos going to warp
2227,startrek,i always found this segment of this episode funnytroi has worf  riker and others in the holodeck and they are trying to piece together what is happening to themcomputer show us a conference tableok the holodeck creates a wood table so far so goodcomputer incline the tableok now its inclined in a weird way mind you but sure its  inclinedcomputer make it a metal tableok so now we get what looks like a metal restraining chair complete with foot rest and various other attachments wtf how do we end up with that as a metal tablei know the computer has some degree of ai capability but seems like a stretch,tng episode schisms - show us a metal table
2228,startrek,&amp;#x200b;he got jacked,this is not quite how i remember gary seven - star trek: year five #17
2229,startrek,i just realized that dr mccoy would have known about michael burnham due to spock’s katra being transferred to him in the wrath of khan you have to assume that he also kept spock’s promise to keep her existence and time travel a secret since everyone from the future thought that discovery was destroyed when they finally made it to the future federation i just thought this was a cool little tidbit to think about given spock and mccoy’s sometimes adversarial relationship - he knew how important it was to spock and never brought it up,dr mccoy knew of michael burnham and kept her secret
2230,startrek,1 many people think the wharfs are changing around like musical chairs why not simply they are swapping kinda like quantum leap which a guy on this reddit mentioned and i think was good theory or that wharf was assimilating his dimension counterparts clone copy type thing i dont like this theory but why would troi say if you make it back probably i wont get my wharf back why why would she say this2 the ending rarely i see it talked about the ending there is no party which subtly suggests he is not in original dimension at all to me i think writers wrote like this to tell us this idea and theory is so far out that everything cannot be perfect there will always be some little change some little difference somewhere i love this epsidoe btw and the ending,2 big questions about the tng episode parallels
2231,startrek,during their war with the federation in the 2250s they massacred entire civilian populations  they murdered hundreds of thousands if not millions of people  there is no honor in massacring those who cant defend themselves  so i would say many klingons have no honor  that doesnt mean there arent those who do have honor  worf thought he massacred a ship full of civilians  and he clearly felt remorse about it  someone like worf would not attack a defenseless opponent  but there are many klingons who would  and i would say that they have no honor  so what you have is an empire of warriors  many who claim to have honor but really dont  without honor they are just an empire of savages  who glorify war for its own sake  instead of using it to defend higher ideals  anyway so let me know what you think in the comments,klingons have no honor
2232,startrek,anyone have any real world similar looking monitors or know where a person could get some the greater functionality the better in particular i like the look of the monitors used in st: enterprise,the various screens/monitors used in trek
2233,startrek,there are reasons why the prime directive is important,the baul were right about the kelpians &amp; michael indirectly caused the burn on star trek discovery

2236,startrek,,the baul were right about the kelpians &amp; michael indirectly caused the burn on star trek discovery
2237,startrek,,question
2238,startrek,  try and follow me on this the concept of the multiverse is based on the idea that for every choice there is a reality that stems from that choice actions and consequences other names and/or depictions of this concept include alternate timelines dimensions realities etc much like with the plot of “steins gate” anime which is based on the “world line theory” now the federation universe is fundamentally different than the mirror universe because essentially the entire universe is different almost polar opposites following the worldline theory each universe belongs to a separate “attractor fields” because event took place that was so significant that it changed the entire reality of that universe to diverge from the federation universe in the mirror universe “terrans” are violent conquerors whom have spread throughout the alpha quadrant enslaving destroying and generally conquering every world they came across the federation universe works much the same way but only in a peaceful manner where humans venture out in an exploration manner with friendly intent and curiosity which ultimately gives birth to the federation of planets  our only point of reference here where the universes go separate paths is during first contact however in the scene where zefram cochrane is to meet the vulcans as you see in star trek enterprise it is almost as if they had been expecting aliens to visit them almost as if they knew aliens were out there zefram cochrane believed that the vulcans were would-be invaders so he killed them and raided their ship why would he think that especially when they were showing peaceful intent enter nog in ds9 the episode “little green men” nog quark and rom end up crashing on earth in the far past it was like the 50’s-60’s era i suppose the fault wouldn’t solely land on nog since his uncle quark was posing attempting to sell future technology to the americans with a threat to sell to their competitors instead which lead to suspicion of their circumstances ultimately it was nog whom laid the final brick in that when he attempted to bluff by telling them they were an advanced scout for an invasion fleet humans specifically americans were very suspicious people at the time due to the russian threat so to plant the seed of doubt in their minds about friendly alien life could have lasted throughout the ages until first contact considering all that i have said the theory stands that nog is the cause and thus creator of the mirror universe  because he created a reality changing event that shaped the future so dramatically that it split the universe into 2 separate universes one where humans were friendly and curious about the galaxy and one where humans were xenophobic and mistrustful of all alien life resulting in their conquering nature,mirror universe theory
2239,startrek,currently watching enterprise season 4 episode 17 i think it was written by a pack of middle schoolers it starts with 3 green belly dancing orion women that are slaves when they get on board enterprise all the men become discombobulated by them the outfits camera angles and dialogue were all gross this is the first episode of enterprise that i have not liked,every high school boys dream

2241,startrek,i read a star trek novel when i was a kid and for whatever reason bits of it keep popping into my head and i want to re-read it i realize it might be awful problem is all i can really remember is that members of the crew were exploring an abandoned space station that seemed to be haunted there was a bit about a maze of corridors and spock suggested staying along the left-hand wall for some logical reason or other thats honestly all i can remember i know its a long shot but does this ring a bell for anyone,trying to find a specific tos novel about an abandoned space station

2244,startrek,how do we think the federation handles a world with uncontacted/isolated tribes on it earth for example currently has a handful of tribes that remain isolated and are protected from outsiders assuming that they endure into the 22nd century qoupd they need to be a part of the united earth or because they are a small fraction of inhabitants they wouldnt impact membership,uncontacted tribes and a united planet

2246,startrek,in star trek there are many races if the borg designation system is anything to go by then there 10000 ish different species out there but i know there are some trek fans out there whom could append certain personality traits and quirks to certain races and i thought it would be interesting to se what race/s people append to my own personality so ill list the trait/quirk of me and maybe a short summary of it and see what races people append to my personalityhere goes ill start with the good traits/quirks:honesty: i truly believe thatone should always be honest no matter the consequenseslogical: i will openly admit that i am definately a man of logicreasonable: i can get hot headed from time to time but im not one for doing domething unreasonableproud: this i can see as both a good thing and a bad thing but in a good way i feel a sense of pride more often then not after acomplishing something that i believe to be significanthumble: i hate toting myself off like the best thing since sliced cheese if anything i think people overestimate my abilitiesloyal: i never turn my back on a friend or family member unless they have done something i cannot forgive them forunderstanding: i am nothing if not willing to pay attention and understand others problemskind: i do think my kindness might lead to my death eventually but i cant help it nothing feels better than showing someone a little kindnesscaring: this trait reinforces alot of my particular gripes about society and the state our world is intolerant: it is very hard to get me all rilled up simple as thatuniverality/keeping things the same: i do love to keep things to just one thing i despise competition like its the bubonic plagueadaptability: to some degree i am adaptable but in others i am notlack of individuality/drone/everyone the same: while i do agree that if everyone was the same the world would be very boring but i would rather live in a boring peaceful world than a diverse chaotic oneanti-capitalist/pro-communist: i despise capitalism and the people who accept it and i fully support communismand no russia was never true communism i suggest you read the communist manifesto by carl marxx before you go giving communism any flachonourable: i am a man with much much honourgo-getter: when something needs doing that i know needs doing i will go do itanti-warring: i truly believe that wars are wasteful illogical unreasonable and unwantedmisanthropic: because of the fact that society refuses to change for the betteraka go back to how society was in the 80s and 90s my hatred of society is quite immensephilantropic: i believe that the world can change for the better and it falls onto those with large sums of money to make that change happen sadlywise: i have those moments where someone asks me for some life advice and i lay on some words of wisdomnostalgic: i love the past i hate the present i am hopeful for the futurereliable: i can always be counted on to get something done that needs to be donenow the bad traits/quirksarrogant: i wouldnt say im fully arrogant but there are things i will flat refuse to accept for one reason or anotherpride: i admit at times pride does blind me but without pride i could never surviveanger: im not quick to anger nor easy to anger but when i do get angry i become very vocal fortunately i am not owtwardly aggressiveregretful/remorsefull: i hate my past and would desperatly love to change itjealous: mostly when it comes to women if i see a beautiful woman attached to another man and not me i do die insidevengeful: only towards one guy from my past but if you push me that far over the edge and yeah i become quite vengefullazy: oh yeah guilty as chargedparanoid: im always looking over my shoulder afraid of getting stabbed in the back for no reasonemotional: emotions are illogical unreasonable and as human history has shown it too unpredictable emotions should always be suppressed although sadly for me my attempts to supress my emotions backfire very miserably anger being the one that is the worst having supressed my anger for nearly 26 yearsi was 27 at time of writing and now bottling up my anger only causes it to burst out worse for an example if say someone is trying to antagonise me on purpose and were pushing me till i snapped my first instict would be to beat the ever beloved shit out of them till they were on the ground unconsious but instead i try to bottle up that anger knowing that letting it out wont do any good and instead i beat the shit out them untill they died so yeah anger is one emotion i have sadly learned that bottling up will only lead to something worse humans make very illogical decisions all based on their emotions not by logicin my own assesment i would say i show more vulcan traits then klingon then borg but maybe thats my self assesment,what race/s do my traits and particular quirks represent
2247,startrek,,if lolcats wrote star trek
2248,startrek,so my theory is that the ancient hebitian people on cardassia prime were actually lost bajoran colonistswe know that bajoran civilization began to flourish “more than five hundred thousand years ago” which is 100 times longer than human civilisation has been around this implies that while the ancient bajorans were renowned for their accomplishments in science mathematics philosophy and the arts as a species they developed very slowly compared to other species as they had only just achieved warp the year the cardassian invasion started presumably a contributing factor with the cardassians potentially being afraid they would lose influence to the bajoransthis means that it’s possible that the bajorans could have been stuck with sunlight technology for hundreds of not thousands of years with the solar sails being a later generation of this presumably the bajorans had thousands of years of space exploration if humans have been exploring space of sorts for 500 yearsthe hebitians the first civilisation on cardassia only emerged about 10000 years before 2376 hundreds of thousands of years after the bajoran civilisation had emerged so my theory is that about 10000 prior to ds9 the bajorans experimented with sunlight generational ships attempting to settle people in nearby worlds the first attempt at these ships was thought lost when they stumbled upon tachyon eddies which accelerated their lightships beyond the speed of light and enabled them to reach the neighbouring cardassian system crash landing in the desert world they established a new civilisation the hebitian civilisation and somehow perhaps through genetic engineering they became cold blooded “reptilians” perfectly adapted to live in a hot desert environmentthere is actually some evidence that could support this first is the fact that bajorans and cardassians are the only two species in the entire franchise that we know can reproduce naturally without any medical intervention binary cloning or genetic tampering at all which is shown or implied to be needed for every other hybrid species this lead to a theory that the two species are somehow the same which forms the basic premise of this theory it’s never explicitly stated so it might not be but it is very likely the bajoran-cardassian hybrids are fertile this fits the common definition of being the same species which implies that even after the alterations that lead to the cardassians different appearance and adaptations the robust genetics remains the samethe ancient humanoids are not an explanation for the ability for the two species to naturally reproduce as i previously stated other specieslile humans and vulcans are shown to require a lot of medical intervention to combine the dna and even then it’s quite rare the species only have a common ancestor in a single cells amoeba that’s like expecting a human and a banana to naturally reproducethere is also the fact that the hebitians were described as being an agrarian society as well as farmers scientists and artists exactly like the bajorans were before the occupationat one point the hebitians feel and the militaristic cardassian civilisation replaced it yet genetically they were still the same species the cardassians grew a deep hatred for the hebitians and tried to eradicate all traces of their culture from cardassia prime perhaps this lead to an unconscious cultural bias against the bajorans or perhaps the cardassians had discovered the hebitians were actually bajorans and destroyed all traces of them to cover it up as it would have negated the belief they were the “superior species”there are a few holes in this theory being that if bajorans were capable of building and launching ships 10000 years ago how exactly the bajorans came to look like cardassians and the exact reason for destroying any traces of the hebitians but if we fill in the blanks the theory would actually make a lot of sense i have tried to give some examples to fill in the blanks such as the potential genetic engineering to tailor the colonists to a desert environmentignoring the ancient humanoids seeding life on planets throughout the galaxy not relevant to the theory what are the chances that two intelligent humanoid species would evolve in neighbouring star systems develop similar cultures and be magically genetically similar enough to be able to produce fertile offspring naturally,hebitians are bajorans
2249,startrek,i have seen every episode of star trek more than once and it got me to thinking about the episode move along home from ds9s first season see here: this was the episode where the entire crew gets trapped in a game at quarks and quark is left to play the game deciding their fate i am of the opinion that this is one of the worst star trek episodes ever produced next to the voyager episode the thawwhat are everyones thoughts,thoughts on ds9 episode move along home
2250,startrek,,what if oh my god what if we are the packleds
2251,startrek,there must be a tremendous number of offworlders who want to move to earth because it is a post-scarcity paradise who decides whether or not an alien gets to live on earth do humans from other worlds get preference how do they vet the immigrants to make sure they arent enemy spies,in the 24th century how is immigration to earth regulated
2252,startrek,the ad in question,does this google ad sound exactly like the bynars primary language to anyone else
2253,startrek,towards the end of the episode georgie and ensign ro were fighting a romulan who was also part of the phaser beam incident  they were like digital ghosts and could walk through walls and people leaving some kind of emission  they ended up pushing the romulan out of the ship and stole his weapon  it looked like he just spirals out into the infinity of space as a digital ghost like form of himself any update on future episodes  they dont say his name he was pretending to be alive and fit in with the other romulans prior to georgie and ro having their fight,anyone know what happened to the romulan that got tossed into space after having a transporter beam failure ng season 5 episode 24

2255,startrek,in the tng episode *where no one has gone before* season 1 the enterprise shoots out of the galaxy and past another  theyre millions of light years away  they send a subspace message to starfleet that data says will take 51 years to reach thereso why couldnt voyager just send a message to starfleet and let them know they were there,why couldnt voyager contact starfleet
2256,startrek,last time i binge watched all of ds9 was in 2008 now im rewatching it and showing it to my wife for the first time she really enjoyed tng enterprise and voyager yes i made her watch those before ds9 to me it doesnt really affect ds9 if i had shown her ds9 before tng now that would have been weirdso anyway the grand nagus vedek winn vedek bareil daxs past lives my god please make it stop,i know it becomes amazing but i forgot how unbearable the first two seasons of ds9 are
2257,startrek,i was watching this episode for the first time in forever and i forgot at the end they didnt really say what happened with the negotiations for the 2 groups to reconcile  picard just of handedly mentions they have a truce and thats it was there ever any mention of what all of that effort amounted to  its odd that until that assasin lady took center stage the crux of the episode was like just forgotten at the end,what happened with the acamarians and gatherers after the vengeance factor

2269,startrek,i was born the year tng came out i grew up on the show in syndication- even went to a convention back in the day and got leonard nimoy’s autograph i remember when ds9 came out i couldn’t see the attraction- i mean they don’t go anywhere- it’s so stationery well if you are anything like me you need to give ds9 a chance i’ve actually stopped watching discovery just to binge ds9 and it’s amazing i can only say the first season and a half of ds9 takes a while to build momentum but holy crap once it gets going it’s like a freight train,i grew up on tng but never watched the other shows- corona has given me the opportunity to binge ds9 and omg what have i been missing for twenty years

2272,startrek,i started my 3rd watch of ds9 yesterday and im currently watching s1e16 the forsaken chief obrien is complaining about and arguing with the onboard computer and i had a thought is the universal translator translating the computer speech to english and also did they switch some sort of local language option in whatever the cardassian version of lcars is,the deep space 9 cardassian computer
2273,startrek,like we know the prophets where in someway contolling siskos life even causing his birth so that he would become captain of ds9 and their emmissary and the death of siskos wife was such a major blow that it had to of in someway contributed to him joining ds9 so its my theory that the prophets caused the battle of wolf 359 and thus the death of his wife so he would be on track for becoming the captain of ds9,ds9 considering the fact that the prophets controlled captain siskos life to get him to the point of being emmissary isnt it possible they is someway contributed to the battle of wolf 359

2279,startrek,there isnt much i like about discovery season one  but i like the terran empire arc  and i have to say that emperor georgiou was a fool for having hundreds of revolutionaries imprisoned on her ship  did it not occur to her that when they escaped they would be pissed and looking for revenge  i know she had a lot of troops on that ship  but she shouldnt have underestimated them  if she was smart she would have put them on another ship  one that she could self destruct by remote if they broke out  and if that wasnt stupid enough she actually let lorca onto her ship  did it not occur to her that that was his plan  she knew that he and micheal were working together  letting him on her ship was really dumb  if i was the ruler of a corrupt empire not a job i would want i wouldnt want anyone near me except for people whos loyalty i was sure of  and i would have them take lie detectors to confirm their loyalty  to let the leader of a band of revolutionaries on your ship when you have hundreds of his followers imprisoned there is really stupid  especially when you know that the person who brought him onboard is working for him  so emperor georgiou was a fool or really overconfident  so its not unsurprising lorca was able to take the throne  he just couldnt hold it  anyway let me know what you think in the comments,emperor georgiou was a fool for having revolutionaries on her ship
2280,startrek,i’m rewatching ds9 and i really believe that garak is the smartest and best written characters in star trek,am i the only one who thinks garak is one of the best written characters in the whole star trek franchise

2284,startrek,thoughts on star trek discovery:star trek discovery isn’t bad because of the casting or diversity it’s bad because of the writing and character decisions all this “forced diversity” is just “diversity” but with an extra word added it’s all about the writing imo they could cast an old black guy and write him so bad and people would dislike it writing is important in a show as big as star trek sexuality and diversity has always been in the franchise as a whole you cannot discredit a show for wanting to do it more the effort of writing is where the struggle for the characters come in your interest in their struggles because that’s what makes a person ‘human’ audiences respond to fear and levels of self doubt and the character development allows all that to flourish when characters grow if a character or characters are already strong then what’s the point there is absolutely no way of riding around the development because they end up as a blank slate aka batwoman example: kate kane literally showed up to gotham with no combat experience and demanded her suit regardless of the fact she never had any fighting or combat experience just like bruce wayne did bruce always trained yet she didn’t and she’s hardly comparable in sizenext is the approach to handling diversity is important you don’t wanna hammer every alphabet in there or race otherwise fans will notice and start to realise it only exists to preach to the audience there are reasons batwoman did so horribly no one not even the “sjws” wanted it but it’s quite strange they were all for it until the show began the ratings dropped and they will continue to so unless they scrap their writers room and get someone who can handle better writing and a less-self indulgent show runner,star trek discovery is ehhh
2285,startrek,so im amongst the many people whose eyes rolled *hard* at the seeming revelation in last weeks episode that a childs tantrum caused the burn and ultimately the deconstruction of the entire galaxy i remain hopeful that this is a misdirect and somehow therell be a more satisfying explanation but i thought it might be fun to spitball some ideas to see what creative minds we have in the sub and to see if we could come up with a more satisfying solution than weve seen so farill start off with a possibility that ive put together im taking it from the beginning of the last episode and keeping everything pretty much the same up until that point personally id have been disappointed if it did end up being a q or something like that because again it would feel to me that discovery is just leaning on nostalgia and not standing on its own two feetso the way i would have played out events is as follows discovery follows the distress signal to the same location the nebula and they still find the dilithium nursery planet inside we know from previous episodes that there were experiments going on to tackle the growing scarcity of dilithium and we find out that the site where the burn began was due to another experiment - someone maybe even the kelpien scientist had developed a spore driveunfortunately they ran into similar problems that discovery and her sister ship did early on - they didnt have a navigator when they activated they were pulled into the dilithium nursery and this triggered a cataclysmic reaction that travelled back along the mycelial network rendering most other dilithium inert since its connected to everything in the galaxy at this point you could have stamets explain that when hes been navigating the network he always felt a pull towards certain places and hadnt considered that they might be places containing massive amounts of dilithium beforenow you could still have osyraa taking over the ship with this plot but she doesnt know that stamets is the navigator and so you have the struggle of trying to convince her not to do a jump/outright trying to stop her so that you have the tension going forward this gets resolved through various stuff havent figured this bit out and eventually all is resolved stamets mentioned that its not just those coordinates hes felt drawn to within the network and therefore its realised that hes able to seek out these dilithium nurseries thereby resolving the shortage and helping to start bring the federation back together again instead of burnham saving the day for a changeany other ideas,discovery season 3 - how would you have written it
2286,startrek,i was thinking conceptually about what a bridge-duty science officer aboard an exploration cruiser like the enterprise d might look like and how they would function  spocks role aboard the tos enterprise wasnt directly revisited and data more-less was ops/science officer whereas ds9 had dax and voyager had samantha wildman     i think the bridge science officer would be a stand-out among other science personnel aboard the ship and have leadership skills in addition to a well rounded-science background with their own specialty  various science department heads that work in the labs aboard the enterprise would report daily to the bridge science officer similar to how chief obrien did his daily maintenance with staff aboard ds9 about findings they want to submit to starfleet / ship-board resource requests / upcoming studies they would like to conduct with their staff  different science disciplines would be represented aboard ship including astrophysics stellar-cartography geology biology ect and the heads of those departments along with their staff would aspire to become a ships bridge officer in their own career,science officer: tng

2294,startrek,these fictional technologies have overall been a detriment to the storytelling in star trek causing numerous inconsistencies and requiring writers to work around them they are the star trek equivalent of mobile phones in horror movies i wish they would remove them from the equation like what if they actually cause irreparable damage to the space-time continuum or some other techno-babble excuse and so the major powers in the galaxy have to sign treaties to ban their use this could also be a good way to introduce a star trek take on current climate accords and similar efforts that require full cooperation for the common good,opinion: replicators and transporters have on balance hurt the writing in star trek and should
2295,startrek,lets say the captain of a ship gets transported to the mirror universe because of a transporter malfunction  could they survive the mirror universe alone  they would be surrounded by assassins everywhere they went becasue crew members on terran ships advance in rank by killing those who outrank  and the person who kills the captain gets to be the next captain  so could one person survive being captain of a terran ship alone  i kind of doubt it  but let me know what you think,could someone survive the mirror universe alone

2297,startrek,i just finished watching the valiant episode of ds9 and while overall i really enjoy this episode one thing that’s always bothered me and that’s karen farris she was automatically distrust and rude to jake and not jake especially every time she came on screen i was immediately annoyed and i wanted to see if anybody else agreed i couldn’t find any posts on here about her so maybe i’m the only one that seemed to hate her,the first officer of the valiant sucked

2301,startrek,i’ve started watching discovery for the 1st time i am left with the nagging question how can their be two red heads on the discovery from everything i have read red heads are going to be extinct by 2150 granted the could be dye jobs but seems like a oversight,first watch of discovery
2302,startrek,hello i started watching tng out of the blue because it’s on hulu just started s3 and i’m noticing two strange things that i can’t explain tried searching for my own answers but found nothing and could use some info:1 video quality at least on hulu seems very bad compared to s1 and s2 if i had to venture a guess i’d say s3 was recorded on magnetic tape whereas s1 and s2 were on conventional film can anyone confirm i’m not some huge snob about things like this just very noticeable2 s3e2 is weird and seems like they badly dubbed several characters voice dialogs especially with goshevinsp any explanation or am i losing my marblesthanks in advance enjoying watching this,newbie with question about tng s3

2307,startrek,*the vast majority of discovery starfleet characters and basically everybody on lower decks even the aliens  reminds me of when picard said in tng that french had become extinct and english had taken over everywhere it reeks of anglo neo-colonialist propaganda,i dont care for the vast majority of discovery and lower decks characters having anglo names

2309,startrek,ive just found out about ds9s what we left behind doc and i feel like i am missing on a lot of great other docs that talk about the shows or even the behind the scenesi know there are many docs around but i have no idea on where to start or even which ones are actually good memory alphas list is actually quite hugeeven though ive only seen tos tas tng and ds9 docs on any of the shows are highly appreciated,what are the must-watch star trek docs
2310,startrek,,is star trek continues canon
2311,startrek,i just found out about the what we left behind doc and it made me wonder if there are any other docs or anything that show the production and behind the scene of the shows not really sure how to ask or even look for it but mainly productions that are widely regarded as must-watchi have only watched tos tas tng and ds9 so far but id love an answer for every show since ill be able to come back to this post later,what are the must-watch behind the scene productions docs tv specials etc of star trek
2312,startrek,i tried asking this before but i think my comparison to a non-star trek work distracted people from the actual request ive seen every star trek film and every episode of every star trek series  except *lower decks* which i started this afternoon ive watched some of the trek series all the way through multiple timesa common thing about the trek films &amp; series is that they all are told from the perspective of starfleet personnel *star trek: picard* toys a little with being non-starfleet  but of course the title character is about as starfleet as you can gethowever i have grown a bit tired of the starfleet perspective so im looking for content in the trek universe thats different since ive already seen *all* the films &amp; tv series can you recommend *other* star trek works ie books comics games really good fan fiction or fan series with the following characteristics: * set in the trek universe* *not* episodes/seasons/installments of any of the existing canon star trek series or films since ive already seen them all* most importantly tells stories from the perspective of *non-starfleet* charactersim hoping to find stories in the trek universe that represent something other than the mission and perspective of starfleet and its personnel i want to experience the perspective of the other inhabitants of the trek universe -- the ones who dont live in a federation ship/base/academy bonus points for content about the dark underbelly of the trek universe i dont know if such a thing even exists  thats why im asking,star trek without the starfleet perspective
2313,startrek,i recently finished watching enterprise - and i really really enjoyed it much better show than anyone gives it credit for obviously i was not a fan of the ending for all the reasons i think anyone could imagine but that made me start thinking about how other trek series have ended did a rewatch of the voyager finale last night - i think i’ve seen it 4 or 5 times now - and it’s the first time i’ve ever wondered “was this a good finale for this show” i have no problem about them finally getting back to the alpha quadrant but i kept thinking “does this ending work for this show”i think my big issue is admiral janeway explicitly calling her past self out for destroying the caretaker’s array i’m sure every fan has their own feelings on it i know i do but i certainly believe that janeway’s actions for the rest of the series strengthen the point she was trying to make by rejecting the array: that the values of starfleet are important and worth struggling for and then you’ve got admiral janeway sayings “no i don’t really think they are not how me and my crew struggled” the finale deals with this quickly by having captain janeway pushback and deus ex borging the admiral out of of the storybut i’ve still got wonderwhat do folks think,how do people feel about voyager’s ending
2314,startrek,first a quick disclaimer i like discovery generally and i am not trying to bash it but i found this odd  in the original mirror mirror the mirror universe was presented as a type of funhouse mirror image of the prime universe  despite the clear differences between the two universes: an evil terran empire as opposed to a peaceful federation the term mirror made sense for everyone was still the same  captain kirk was the captain of the enterprise in both universes  spock was still the first officer scotty the chief engineer for both as well  uhura sulu chekov almost everyone down the line was still doing the same thing their counterparts were in prime universe  dr mccoy managed to spill acid in the same place in both realties    on discovery however it is different   philippa georgiou is the captain of the shenzhou her fate is she is killed and eaten by klingons  in the mirror  philippa georgiou is emperor of the terran empire has conquered the klingons and eats kelpiensmichael burnham was at the start of the series first officer of the shenzhou before her fall  in the mirror was the shenzhous captain and heiress apparent to the empiresylvia tilly at the start of the series was a starfleet cadet while her mirror counterpart was the captain of the discovery thoughts,why in discovery are the mirror universe humans better than the prime universe counterparts
2315,startrek,spoilers for discovery season 3x11 below first i know i wont be covering any new ground so i apologize  but ive become frustrated with a thing i love star trek and think venting might make me feel better second i am 40 years old and have been a star trek fan all my life i remember being teased for it in elementary school hiding it in high school and beyond going to conventions in the 90s and starting for hours at mr scotts guide to the enterprise and the enterpise d technical manual  i have watched all of it and mostly love all of it  my opinions on the kelvin universe are a separate rambling postmy rant:  i have enjoyed discovery for most of its run so far i have the same criticisms i think most of us have and clearly see the shows flaws the frantic pace of the first two seasons the awkward storytelling making michael the center of the universe etc but the most recent episode is the first time ive felt close to giving up i obviously wont but i hate feeling like this -i hate ensign tilly being number one as much as i hate pines kirk being acting captain but i understand the showrunners like the actor and character so ive tried to go with it  she did a good job in the role but she was a cadet one season ago and there are more experienced officers available  its beyond absurd watching it in action    -stamets trying to prevent hugh from going on the mission was strange awkward to watch and makes no sense  theyre both professional star fleet officers  its what they signed up for  plus its far from the most dangerous mission weve seen a character go on  i didnt understand it  we already know they love each other  -the adira and gray subplot is pointless  him going away maybe helped develop adiras character somewhat but we find out he went away forreasons and now hes back forother reasons  his return was out of place in this episode and felt forced  i like the character adira but could have passed on gray coming back  -also have we established that people can just beam through shields  what was the point of upgrading discovery with 31st-century tech  -finally and maybe most importantly making the burn be an emotional alien weve never heard of feels like a slap in the face  i know weve seen gary mitchell and other hyper-powerful beings in star trek before but this is a season-long arc  maybe itll be better in the final two episodes but this is rough  why do writers of things we love feel the need to subvert expectations so much  got and star wars sequels anybody  this could have been the omega particle  and somehow fixed by discoverys spore drive  keep the rest of the season arcs and get rid of the exploding dilithium planet and come up with some way discovery has to risk itself to save the future of the federation  i dont know  im not a paid writer if youve read all of that i appreciate you  i do feel better writing it all out  and now i feel silly letting a tv show frustrate me but here we are,i hope its okay to rant dis

2327,startrek,its been a few years since she committed mutiny  i think were due for another mutiny soon  do you think she would be punished if she mutinied and then saved the federation  i would say any other character probably not but she would probably get another life sentence  they were pissed at her  and demoted her for just going on one rogue mission even though she rescued slaves and got valuable intel on the burn  so i think if she committed mutiny but saved the federation or even the galaxy they would still throw the book at her  it just shows how rigid and inflexible starfleet is  its amazing they can get anything done considering how many rules they have to follow  of course most captains break as many as they can get away with  anyway let me know what you think in the comments,will michael burnham mutiny again

2330,startrek,over the holiday ive binged both *star trek: discovery* and *star wars: the mandalorian* i know i know bear with me: this is a trek question ultimately im struck by the difference between the st and sw universes not a new revelation of course trek is roddenberrys post-scarcity shiny positive outlook for the future while in george lucass world the good guys also eventually win sorry if thats a spoiler; get over it the star wars stories dont hesitate to dive into the seedy side of its universe rogues smugglers1  bounty hunters junk dealers slavery criminals etc in a way that rarely occurs with star trek and its focus on the frankly goody two-shoes federation crewsinitially i was excited that *star trek: picard* seemed to be going a different way in the first few episodes but it swung back to typical star trek morality play-style by the end of season 1 the &gt;terran empire and section 31&lt; injected a little welcome intrigue and moral ambiguity into season 2 of *discovery* but not as much as i would have liked so the question ive seen all the series and films now except for *lower decks* which is up next in my queue but i havent explored much outside the films &amp; tv shows **are there *any* star trek works books comics games etc  maybe even really good fan fiction that a are set in the trek universe but b dont tell stories about a federation ship and its crew and c deal with the grittier side of the star trek universe**1 wrong forum i know but *han shot first*,the gritty side of trek

2342,startrek,i am new to the trekkie world i have watched all of the original series and on the last season of tng we are also watching the movies together and we just finished watching the search for spock  i know it is kind of hard to compare them since they have very different leadership styles and live in different type of galaxy but i still feel kirk is an overall better captain who is an asset to his crew beyond the bridge and you get to watch him earn his experiences and reputation   i like picard dont get me wrong but most of his achievements are in the past and we are just told about most them and it just feels like they fluffed his record and which makes his level of renown feel unearned especially when he just takes a back seat a lot of the time in the series  so let me know your opinions and please lets keep this civil i am truly curious for everyones insight,my gf and i keep having a debate on whom we think is the better captain kirk or picard

2347,startrek,oh my god and i thought i felt empty inside when i finished tng i had heard great things about ds9 for years and just from the bits i did hear i knew it was probably going to be my favorite star trek series while ive only finished tos and tng i think its safe for me to say that i was right and that ds9 is my absolute favorite i think the best indicator for how much i enjoyed it is this: it took me around a year maybe a year and a half to finish tos i took me two years to finish tng it took me around two months to finish ds9 dont get me wrong i absolutely love tos and tng and also probably has something to do with the former twos heavier episodic focus but i just couldnt get enough of ds9while i did miss the episodic exploration focused style of tng i think ds9 more than made up for it with how well it handled its characters and story this was easily my favorite cast of characters in star trek and i dont see them being topped each one of them were so interesting and layered and had excellent development throughout shout out to kira for being my favorite character and my second favorite star trek character period even the minor characters were amazing to the point where id say i like damar nog weyoun rom and martok just as much and in some cases more than some main cast members in previous star treks and theit relationships were so great it even gave the best bromance ever this is seriously one of the greatest casts ive ever had the joy of experiencing in mediaand the stories were excellent many of the episodic adventures were amazing easily just as good if not better than the best of tng and when the sequential episodes were fantastic and really showed that star trek could work in different formats than just the typical episodic structure i also have to applaud it for being the most consistent show tos has its very underwhelming third season tng has a rocky start and while the last two seasons are great i felt as though the consistency was starting to dip a bit ds9 however was great from beginning to end if anything it only gets bettter i think ive heard that people arent too fond of the first season and while i agree that it was the weakest one and you could tell that they were finding their footing i honestly thought it was pretty good probably around the same level of quality as tng s6 and 7 maybe a bit lower i also want to tackle some more spoiler heavy topics mainly concerning stuff that i either have issues with or am just a bit mixed on so ill go into those now:&gt;might as well start with dukat what an amazing villain at first i didnt understand why people loved him and then i watched neccessary evil and it all became clear however i know some people do not like the direction his character went after sacrifice of angels personally i like it but i do admit that i liked pre-breakdown dukat a good bit more than post-breakdown dukat like i think it makes sense story and character-wise especially when the pah wraiths really come into the mix and i do think that they needed to either get rid of dukat or do something new with him after soa and hes still an enjoyable character and villain but i do enjoy him when hes more of a complex character rather than a raving mad man out for revenge hes still a good character just different and simpler&lt;&gt;speaking of the pah wraiths im not really sure what to make of them they work as a way to create conflict in order to give the whole prophets plotline an ending but they just sort of felti guess segmented from everything else especially near the end that last showdown with sisko and dukat wasnt bad but rather than an plotline that felt as if it were as equal to the dominion war in terms of importance it felt more like the story went oh wait one more thing and quickly took care of it i guess i can sum my thoughts up as i think it was a good idea that could have been integrated better oh yeah and kai win almost forgot about her again i think her character arc in s7 made sense but it was over a bit too quick for me and was too isolated from everything else&lt;&gt;i am definitely not a fan of the odo and kira romance never got why they kept pushing it in that direction okay i kinda get it for odo but not kira especially after how he acted when the dominion took over ds9 i loved their friendship i think they worked great as friends but as lovers im sorry i dont buy kira having romantic feelings for a guy who has done and believes in some very sketchy things that go against her beliefs and values&lt;&gt;jadzia is the character who grew on me the most going from a character that i didnt have any strong feelings towards at all to one i really liked i knew her death was coming i dont remember how i got spoiled i think i looked up the cast or something and got spoiled that way but it still got to me not the biggest fan of how it was handled and from what ive heard from the bts stuff im disappointed in why it happened but i think killing off a main character worked for ds9 and it being the one who could technically come back made for some interesting stories i like ezri and i think they did a good job at integrating her with only one season left but i admit throughout s7 i kept thinking i miss jadzia and i wonder what this scene would be like if it where jadzia instead again i like them both though&lt;&gt;to end the spoiler section on a positive note i really have to give credit to how the handled damar because wow i am honestly surprised with how well the handled him and how much i like him as a character i honestly thought he would just be some minor grunt who i would like but not think much of but his development from a grunt to a miserable drunk who reluctantly serves the dominion to a revolutionary who leads his people to freedom was just perfect and to have him come to some level of understanding when it comes to how horriblethe bajoran occupation was through the dominion occupation of cardassia was fantastic and again demonstrates how nuanced star trek and ds9 especially can be when it comes to writing it doesnt absolve him of all the horrible things he had done but it does show that even someone like damar has the capacity to grow and i truly think that if he had lived that he would have tried to repent for the bajoran occupation in someway again doesnt absolve him but at least it shows that he had the capacity to be a better man i seriously just love damar as a character hes one of my top favorite star trek characters&lt;i feel like i said everything i needed to and i expect that i havent said anything that hasnt already been discussed many times but i hope youve enjoyed my excited rambling deep space nine was truly something special and it has become something that i will hold with me forever now to watch what we left behind and then onto voyager i know that from here on out things get more contentious but im going to go into voyager with an open mind and a positive attitude and hopefully come out the other end satisfied and as one last note to end on i thought id give my tenative top 10 episodes in no specific order: neccessary evil the visitor far beyond the stars in the pale moonlight tacking into the wind rocks and shoals the die is cast civil defense its only a paper moon and what you leave behind,i just finished watching deep space nine for the first time and i have to gush
2348,startrek,federation starships have awful security  here are a few ideas for how to have better security and how to repel boarding parties  1 put a self destruct button on the captains chair  that can only be activated by the captain  the computer can confirm its the captain by dna scan  also label it something different so its not obvious its a self destruct button  have the self destruct button also lockout the computer and command functions  the boarders can either leave or be vaporized2 have the computer track crew members so it can identify non crew members  and increase gravity by five or ten times to pin them to the floor  and or beam them into the brig or the shuttlebay  3 use transporter scrambers to prevent boarding actions in the first place  no one is going to want to beam aboard your ship if they think they are going to end in trillions of pieces4 holographic soldiers  use holographic soldiers to repel boarding parties  you could make an army of holograms that activate if the ship is boarded5 interior defenses  set up turrets and maybe smoke grenades throughout the ship  if anyone beams onbard without permission the turrets stun them while the smoke grenades create a distraction  6 for the 32nd century you could program the programmable matter consoles to strangle anyone who isnt a member of the crew  or have them turn into phasers and stun non crew members7 make it so that the self destruct button also activates all of the ships defenses and does all of the above  you could arm the self destruct and beam the boarding parties into the brig  and activate holographic soldiers  and interior defenses  and have the programmable matter deal with the boarding parties etc  basically activating all of the ships security systems with one button  so the federation really needs to have plans to repel boarding parties  and have better security on their ships  these are just a few ways they can do that,how to repel boarding parties
2349,startrek,im obviously talking about owo detmar bryce and that other dude whos always on the bridge whose name i dont even know they have been there since like the first episode i think been years since i watched season 1 and they dont really have character and rarely any storylines also they are on the bridge in literally every scene that takes place there like dont they ever get a break discovery isnt any good at writing storylines for characters other than the main ones,side characters in discovery that should have bigger roles
2350,startrek,people seem to board ships and just do whatever they want with little resistance that drives me nuts lol imagine a starfleet ship that could deploy holographic security anywhere on board with the safety off with any type of weaponeven hand to hand/melee weaps they could easily build projection emitters all over holograms dont have to be limited to the holodeck starships could also have mini-turrets or phaser banks built into the corridors to fire upon invading forces the computer can detect where anyone is so why does it never detect unregistered crew and react it could be set to monitor life signs distress etc and even weapons fire on board and send a hologram to see what is happening and report its just absurd to me how easily the bad guys can just come on board and wreck the place at least combat specialty holograms would give a starship crew a fighting chance in the event they get boarded,despite being advanced in the future ship security in star trek sucks

2353,startrek,a lot of people in star trek dont seem to grasp the basic truth about diplomacy   diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies  or on rare occasions when they just happen to be sane and reasonable  but how often is that the case  if the federation was more powerful then the borg then they could negotiate a peace treaty with them  because the borg would know that if they didnt sign the treaty they would be wiped out  or that a war would cost them too much  so diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies  otherwise diplomacy will fall on deaf ears  if the federation really wants peace then they should start arming their ships better and preparing for war  if their neighbors think that a war will be too e expensive then they will be more inclined to want peace  this is why the romulans havent gone to war with the federation in two centuries  in kirks era he destroyed a bird of prey that was testing federation defenses  and in picards era the alliance between the klingon empire and the federation kept the romulans at bay  so if the federation really wants peace it should start building more warships  so that is the truth about diplomacy   if you have a bigger stick diplomacy will work  if not it will likely fall on deaf ears  so let me know what you think the comments,the truth about diplomacy
2354,startrek,it wouldnt hurt to see bashir and a few more genetically enhanced humans in a new star trek series or maybe in picards spin-off hence the fact that bashir — the actor not the character wants in on an episode of picard or a future trek series due to an article i want to see genetically enhanced humans or geh within all the quadrants and maybe a comic between the q sure it could be a little dull because they would have some sort 100% success or lower of probability depending on the scenario — no such thing as no win scenario unless it wasnt realistic they would also leave no margin for error if the writers can do the same thing with data — which was accepting androids to an extent i want to see them do the same thing with geh cause they did revive that concept in archers time which lead to dr soongs creation data and lore — possibly khan but it was never said or so i think according to moore *i kept saying whats the secret of bashirs past whats the thing that this guy zimmerman is going to find thats so interesting i remember that rené and i started talking about genetics and rené pointed out that genetic engineering is one of the things that is oddly missing in the star trek universe its a concept thats very much out there in science fiction and even in the real world of science but in star trek its virtually never discussed aside from the fact that there was this thing called the eugenics wars at some point and khan came out of it that conversation ultimately led moore to come up with the idea that bashir was genetically enhancedtl;dr: i want to see more genetically enhanced humans in star trek i want to see more than just a glimpse of the eugenics wars and if the genetically enhanced humans were ever actually accepted into society proving that they could actually function without causing wars like bashir then i guess it could be fine kind of like spock after genesis – which didnt change anything just his memory or maybe like terry mcginnis from batman beyond,a new star trek involving more than just a couple of genetically enhanced humans

2356,startrek,it has hands down always been my favorite trek show it has so much to offer and i feel like each time ive watched it i came away with something more i first watched it as a kid with its original airing i loved the epic space battles and cool aliens and it really cemented my love of the sci fi genre tng always felt like it had the alien of the week whereas ds9 just had the casualness of the background characters walking on the station and the makeup dept could just do anything they wanted it felt like better world building my 2nd watch through was about 10 years ago when netflix first started streaming i was older and could better appreciate the politics and relationships ill never understand why the show got flak for switching to season and series spanning arcs for their stories it leads to amazing character development with great actors really getting to flesh out their roles on this third watch i really was able to pay attention to the writing and catch all the fun little things they threw into their scripts over the years self-sealing stembolts and 2309 bloodwine being just a couple of the little things that i never would have caught as a kid watching 1 episode a week but now when we can binge and seeing them get carried through all the seasons as little in-jokes and throwaway lines where you can tell the writers were just having fun is nice i feel like ds9 was the total package when it came to episodic science fiction it gave us space battles cool aliens romance politics religion espionage and intrigue science and engineering with the fun treky twist and through it all just told a good story i cant wait to watch it for a 4th time when my kid is old enough to appreciate it,just finished my 3rd full watch of ds9

2367,startrek,let’s try this againthe borg have a hive mind just like bees ants and termites they are social creatures and they act as one as one living organism**facts we know about how borg work:**1 they move as one because they assimilate other species to be perfect2 they can communicate to each other and hear other voices all the time3 its a online connection that isnt broken unless they become a individual4 seven of nine got separated and was very scared and agitated to be apart from the collective**facts we know about how bees work:**1 they work as one single organism within the hive as workers and drones2 they can communicate with each other through nothing more then a few “dancing” movements3 the connection between the bees is unbroken unless one gets separated from the hive and becomes an individual4 bees separated from their hive are known to sting people and animals which is a sign of them being scared or agitatedhive minds don’t literally have one single mind they have individual connected minds that act like a single consciousness each brain acts like the individual cells of a larger brainthe borg queen literally control every drone as if they were puppets in reality she is just the mouth piece for diplomatic purposes she is even created by the drones themselves to function as a “mother” figure we even see her die at least 3 times only to be replaced by a new queen therefore the collective didn’t “explode” on her death as they continued existing without her**some definitions of hive minds:**1 a notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another regarded as producing either uncritical conformity or collective intelligence2 in science fiction a unified consciousness or intelligence formed by a number of alien individuals the resulting consciousness typically exerting control over its constituent members3 the apparent consciousness of colonies of social insects such as ants bees and termiteshive minds exist in earth there’s no reason to assume the borg hive mind would work differentlyso stop being a pakled crying about the borg having a queen and being rude to anyone who likes the idea of a borg queen just because you misunderstood basic science when the borg were first introducedthe borg with the queen not only fit the definition of a hive mind but acts in the same way hive minds act,why the borg queen makes sense

2371,startrek, who watches the watchers was actually the first tng episode that was pretty good  buti had issues  who watches the watchers stirred me up&gt;troi: according to doctor barrons preliminary reports the mintakans are proto-vulcan humanoids at the bronze age level quite peaceful and highly rational  picard: which is not surprising considering how closely their evolution parallels vulcanpicard you’re an idiot when the vulcans were in their bronze age they were skewering each other like crazy they only got peaceful and rational after inventing space travel and nearly annihilating themselves in their own version of world war iii&gt;crusher: before you start quoting me the prime directive hed already seen us the damage was done it was either bring him aboard or let him die  picard: then why didnt you let him diepicard you’re an asshole i don’t think i need to explain why&gt;troi: mintakan emotions are quite interesting like the vulcans they have highly ordered minds a very sensible peopleoh thank you troi what would we ever do without your insights&gt;barron: picard you must beam palmer aboard immediately without medical attention  picard: its not as simple as that he is surrounded by mintakans if he dematerialises before their eyes the impact  barron: it will slightly increase the cultural contamination which already exists a small price for saving palmers lifebarron is of course right just seeing an alien was enough to convince the villagers that something outside their experience is going on and the picard is real it makes no difference if they see palmer vanish mysteriously or he vanishes mysteriously without anyone seeing it and having an alien dead body or prisoner won’t help either&gt;picard: number one  picard \oc\: is there any chance of your freeing palmer and transporting up unseen  riker: we can try  picard \oc\: try hardpicard you idiot;&gt;barron: like it or not we have rekindled the mintakans belief in the overseer  riker: and are you saying that this belief will eventually become a religion  barron: its inevitable and without guidance that religion could degenerate into inquisitions holy wars chaos  picard: horrifying doctor barron your report describes how rational these people are millennia ago they abandoned their belief in the supernaturalactually if it was that long ago they wouldn’t even remember they ever had it&gt;now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement to send them back into the dark ages of superstition and ignorance and fear no we will find some way to undo the damage weve causedhere is the fundamental problem with the episode the mintakans have seen something they didn’t comprehend and this has revived religion among themexcept…**they live in the bronze age**they see things they don’t comprehend every day every time they have an outbreak of infectious disease or a lightning strike or a meteor rain or the flipping sun rising in the morning they’re seeing something they don’t have an explanation for humans in the bronze age invented gods for a reason they didn’t need alien astronauts to do itif the mintakans don’t believe in gods it’s because unlike humans they don’t have a widespread need for gods gods answer questions people aren’t content to leave unanswered without that need this “religion” certainly isn’t going to spread beyond the actual eyewitnesses to the weirdness and even the eyewitnesses probably wouldn’t conclude anything more than the basically accurate “there’s a strange round-eared tribe with powers we do not comprehend”&gt;picard: if you believe i am all-powerful then you cannot hurt me if however i am telling the truth and i am mortal you will kill me but if the only proof you will believe is my death then shoot  nuria: liko dont do it  oji: father no  oji jolts likos arm enough to deflect the arrow into picards shoulder nuria holds up her blood-stained hand to liko and he bursts into tearspicard…you idiot what do osiris baldr herakles quetzalcoatl and jesus all have in commonthey all have stories *where they die* and are worshipped as gods anywayhere’s the thing the episode from start to finish is tainted with subtle contempt for the mintakans because they aren’t as technologically advanced as the humans for all of picard’s pretensions to the contrary do you know how kirk would have handled this problem he would have beamed down walked up to the village and said “you have a member of my tribe could i please have him back” he would have explained that his people were nomads who would soon be gonethe problem would have been solved but picard and the federation didn’t have enough respect for the mintakans to deal with them as beings just as mentally capable as they are even though they don’t have as many toys so instead they treat the mintakans as children who need to be sheltered from any hint of reality and fumble around making things worse at every turn it’s an insult to the mintakan intelligence and to that of the audience,my rant about who watches the watchers

2388,startrek,so far weve seen some cool new tech in discovery that does feel like a big leap from what weve seen in earlier trek shows programmable matter floating nacelles etc however am i the only one who finds it bizarre that weapons dont really seem to have advanced at all in particular with torpedoeswe saw earth use quantum torpedoes however it looks like both starfleet and the emerald chain are still using photon torpedoes as their standard weaponry i can just about buy into quantum torpedoes being the standard weapon given it was an advanced new weapon in the late tng era you can see how they may have refined that over a few centuries then engaged in a temporal weapon arms race before reverting back to conventional weapons which didnt develop further during the temporal wars due to the temporal accords / limited resourcesphoton torpedoes however seemed to have reached their limits in the tng era and we know from when discovery arrived at starfleet hq that hull technology has advanced significantly so its hard to see how these would still be an effective weaponas for phasers at least theyve been intentionally more vague but the effects still look like star wars style lasers from the earlier seasons of discovery rather than more sophisticated beam style weaponry its like they couldnt be bothered to come up with new vfxits rather frustrating as surely this is a really easy thing for them to get right - just invent some new technobabble weaponry like they did many times in the tng era and dont elaborate on the details as they have avoided doing consistently so far in discovery,31st century weapons

2411,startrek,well a few of the reasons anyway :the psychedelic references and visuals troughout the showthe fact they even named paul stamets after one of my psychedelic heroes namely the real paul stamets and consulted him the referenses to psilocybin and visuals of the mycelium network makes it pretty clear the makers of discovery have seen some psychedelic realms themselves the show is packed with obvious and hidden psychedelic references and the trill episode was simply mind blowing reminded me of ayahuascha although far fetched i love the whole mycelium network thing and spore drive besides i have loved anything related to time travel and alternative universe discovery is quicly taking 2nd place in my list closely behind ds9im sorry but i find discovery much much better than picard i struggled with micheal 1st season but now love her picard is ok but i was a bit disappointed on the story line i really really prefer the post nemesis novel timeline instead picard is well in my opinion at  leastmore picard at least discovery kept some novel references like section 31 control ok that was my psychedelic rant of the day,why i love discovery

2418,startrek,because its a political agenda and not a scifi adventure storythere is a disproportioned number of female charactersfemales occupy all strenght and power roles real men are non exhistant or either gay alientrans or just non whitethis is just a new generations political indoctrination to cancel culture and identity to force an ideology view,star treck discovery is not good

2421,startrek,heyai was just sad that star trek online was 100% combat and nothing elsei was more or less expecting to fly through a large open universe meeting maybe even procedurally generated alien races with their own problems moral dilemmas transmissions emergency hailing logic puzzles language translation puzzles first contact basically a deduction and puzzle game with some combat eveninternal ship drama building a crew customizing uniforms using the holodeck for mini games or relaxation exploring the ship on foot; basically a customizable star trek rpg powered by procedural generation roleplaying opportunities and your own choicesis there anything like that on the market right now even if it is just a game that isnt star trek but i can roleplay as star trekif not i might just try my hand at it myself as an indie dev,are there star trek or trek inspired games that are non-combat focused
2422,startrek,id have to with ds9s the visitor beautiful episode what is yours,which episode of star trek is the biggest tear-jerker
2423,startrek,this will spoil anything including this weeks episodein the approximate month the admiral has known of the discovery its had 3 or 4 incidents of insubordination or refusal of orders and had already given saru a warning about his command that led to him making a green ensign 1st officer from the outside discovery must seem chaotic and at risk of mutiny now we have a situation where the captain backed tilly to his face and she failed at the first hurdle which is not just bad for her reputation its hugely damaging to how competent saru looks to a 32nd century observer on top of what looks like pretty sketchy ability to follow basic chain of command stuffso in the next episode why isnt the admiral going to decide enough is enough on board his prize asset and bring the discovery home for some briefing that turns into demotions for the senior officers and mass reassignment for the crew like the federation said when they met only starmets is actually needed and refusing the transfers would only show hes right to break up the crew for being dangerously close to mutiny and by now the federation must be well on the way to duplicating the drive the spores and the pilot sp even stamets only has so much unique value,why does the admiral trust discovery
2424,startrek,has to be when q was on the bridge with the mariachi band i couldnt stop laughing then data went all giggles too,funniest moment on star trek next gen
2425,startrek,i saw the post earlier in the month about the 2020 hallmark ornaments i figured id wait until after christmas to see if they get marked down at all and if not buy them anyway i had them in my cart and then after midnight they all went out of stock they still show if you search for them but lead to a broken product page are these typically pulled after christmas or did they just all magically sell out at the same time last night,2020 hallmark ornaments
2426,startrek,,my gf got me a tin whistle for christmas guess what the first thing we learned together the inner light - star trek - tin whistle tabs play along tutorial
2427,startrek,as we have seen with the mandalorian the future of star trek should be in the past and document the conflicts of the dominion war  similar to a world war ll epic movie or tv show like band of brothers the series will be cannon and resemble the time period my suggestion is that season 1 of this new star trek series should take place at the beginning of the war when deep space nine was captured and a federation klingon taskforce destroyed dominion shipyards at torros lll the rest of the first season will continue on with the war for three months and will conclude with the defeat of the seventh fleet in the tyra system by using the framework of the dominion war and locking in key timeline moments such as the invasion of betazed and romulans entering the war this could be the show that many star trek fans dreamed about,dominion war tv series
2428,startrek,,grey isnt a spectacular character
2429,startrek,,i will get banned from star trek for saying the actor who plays gray isnt great
2430,startrek,i dont know exactly where the switch happened but if that isnt a glowing review of how discoverys been doing this season i dont know what is for the past few episodes i have been 100% on board with the show and waiting with bated breath for each episode it is whole-heartedly star trektheres no real point to this post besides the neat revelation has anyone else experienced the same,i had a realisation: ive stopped referring to discovery as discovery in my head few the past while ive just been calling it star trek
2431,startrek,i recently finished the tng series i am planning on watching the subsequent movies as well however how should i pursue watching the other shows like voyager ds9 discovery etc post-wesley crusher show jk picard,finished star trek: the next generation - now what
2432,startrek,i have watched about half the first season and i have very much enjoyed the dumb space comedy in the star trek universe my question is why is there so much hate for it i know it’s not “conventional trek” but it is a lot of fun it fell a lot like “the orville” which i also enjoyed in the words of the “greatest generation” star trek is a place and i think it’s a good thing cbs is trying new things just curious of the views on why people don’t like it,is the general consensus that “lower decks” is bad
2433,startrek,,who would replace picard ⁉️
2434,startrek,i used to enjoy discovery but the last 3 episodes made me cringe the entire show feels like filler after filler finally the story continues and the cause of the burn is a child aka 125 year old kelpian who we all know will turn out to be the monster instead of the perfectly shaped kelpian,discovery went to far spoilers
2435,startrek,just finished watching episode 11 of disco season 3 and it got me thinking the burn is basically the omega particle times a lot it crippled space fairing society in a different way and that made me wonder which governing law takes priority the temporal accords put into place to end the temporal war which saw rival civilizations messing up each others histories for dominance ***or*** the omega protocol which is in place to ensure space travel stays viable so galactic society as a whole can exist which one is the more prime directive if the two should come into conflict does using time travel to undo a galactic catastrophe take priority or does a galactic catastrophe stay in play to avoid a new war across spacetime,which would take priority: temporal accords or omega directive

2438,startrek,so i was going to comment this on another post but ultimately decided to make my own post instead also disclaimer i have seen tos and most of tng as well as most of the movies otherwise i havent seen much else and so these arguments mainly apply to tos and tng but can also refer to others that also means that understandings of ethics from the writers are likely outdated and thus these missteps from my perspective may not be entirely their fault oh and this is all on mobile so many apologiesas we know the use of the prime directive pd has been pretty inconsistently applied throughout the franchise but from what i recall they are nearly always false dilemmas rather than a true moral one an episode centering around the pd usually centers around the following question: do we interfere with a peoples natural progression if it means helping them when we talked about ethics in my classes i went to grad school for anthropology so it was kinda important this becomes an issue with two main dimensions: knowledge vs ignorance and life vs cultural purity an episode focusing on pd usually starts the plot where starfleet notices a problem that the native people have no way of noticing lets say a natural disaster a ton of the episode is spent with the cast debating 1 whether to help at all and 2 if the people can be helped secretly but the actual people who would be affected almost never get input it is as if because these people fail to meet arbitrary advancement requirements space travel they are treated as if they are incapable of making decisions on their own behalf this is the failing in how pd is treated in such episodes the various cultures arent any less intelligent just because they cant go to space they simply lack access to the same information as starfleet does if we applied that to current comparisons that is like saying that a modern hunter-gatherer is dumber because they cant drive a car also assuming that if they had access to a car that they would even want to flipping that it would be saying that anyone reading this post is dumb if they dont know how to identify safe and edible plants in the wild the inca a very complex civilization never developed the concept of the wheel did that make them any less intelligent no it doesnt so why does starfleet refuse to include them in discussions about their future ill get back to this but first let me shift to the second part of the issue: life vs cultural purity yes the act of contacting them in order to ask for their input would introduce concepts and technology that they may not be ready for but this is like the trolley experiment refusing to take action resulting in larger loss of life than whatever sacrifices taking direct action would take is not a passive thing the moment starfleet notices something will happen anything they do at that point even if it is to do nothing is still a specific choice on their part if starfleet truly wishes not to interfere then they must also completely avoid those people by observing they are just setting themselves up to make these choices if starfleet truly wanting nature to take its course they will truly let these people be but they dont by observing them they must accept that sometimes there are negative affects to doing such research cant have your cake and eat it too literally the only reason not to help is because it will mess with the natural progession of the people in question but thats that makes a ton of assumptions if a cultural has any contact with starfleet they will just what abandon their own culture and copy starfleet thats an incredibly laughable concept honestly not only do people interact with those of other cultures all the time and not just 100% assimilate but if they find ideas they do genuinely like whats the harm in holding it back it isnt like starfleet is colonizing the planet by saving them from a volcano they arent forcing these people to abandon everything they know and love the native people will adopt what they want and keep what they want this is the very common phenomenon called transculturation ideas are shared between cultures all the time and all cultures involved change in some way because of it change isnt necessarily a bad thing so why is it such a big deal in pd episodes because looking at it from this perspective makes the whole argument shaky at best if we save them they will want to copy us but we want them to be themselves so we wont even give them the choice of letting us help them pretty absurd to me so why does this come up a lot in trek honestly it is an easy way to give a moral dilemma on television writers want these characters to be able to have ethical debates but also want them to be universally loved so the solution is to paint the issue as more grey than it truly is so that when the characters do make the right decision it is hard fought if they make the wrong one then it is more excusable win-win for the writers personally i think the true ethical debate would be if after such a culture is contacted they refuse the help for whatever reason now that would be very difficult since the starfleet characters in question know they can help but are required to respect the decision of the planets inhabitants what the characters do would be good insights into them as individuals honestly and if such an episode exists please point me to it so i can see it play out,the prime directive: a false dilemma
2439,startrek,,not a trekkie myself but thought you’d all appreciate my father-in-law’s epic star trek christmas tree
2440,startrek,fan theory: gagh is alien in origin it did not evolve on qonos but was instead an invasive species of blight from the hurq homeworld it is revered in klingon society because kahless was the first klingon to use his weapons as farm tools to grow food from the land instead of relying on a hunter-gatherer way of life to survive this basically kicked off a neolithic revolution that was instrumental to the klingons resisting and eventually overthrowing the hurqthis theory is a combination of multiple theories:assumption 1: the klingons are a race of obligate carnivores they need relatively fresh meat to sustain themselvesassumption 2: the klingons were a slave/game race created by the hurqconclusion: gagh is the only real klingon food that can be mass produced as a staple crop prior to its domestication klingons were pack hunters with total/local populations too small to effect any real resistance to the hurq invasion due to the basic limits of how needing prey animals to eat the available plant-life before you can eat the animals looses %90 of the total food energy a given area can produce,gagh is so revered in klingon culture because worms are the only thing a species of obligate carnivores can effectively farm
2441,startrek,im finding it incredibly dull and childish i originally was skeptical but then i turned around in season 1 and really started enjoying it it wasnt as good in season 2 but i got through it and though there could be good potential in season 3 this season seems to be even worse than early voyager and thats saying a lothere are some of my beefs:* they cant just bring back daddy lorca even though he was my favorite character they had the perfect opportunity* i hate that annoying low voice they use to talk to each other nobody else is around why are you whispering* the seasons had burnham having the most focus but now the focus on burnham has far exceeded previous seasons why shes not the captain since when has a star trek series focused more on someone thats not the captain shes not even the first officer* idiot childish stories go to a planet to solve a physiological/time travel issue and you just happen to encounter the guardian of forever and its 1000x more campy than the original tos episode* thats rude of you to refer to me as she/her you should be able to read minds and tell that i go by they/them* tilly got fat that is inexcusable anyway merry christmas and dont let me take away your enjoyment of the show if you enjoy it,i tried but i just cant watch this anymore
2442,startrek,i think this is more glaringly obvious in tos as well as ent perhaps pic as well i know personally that disco actually goes on location to shoot in other places because they have a much bigger budget for cinematic effects what about voyager and ds9,which star trek series use the same sets for outdoor scenes

2449,startrek,so i need some help guys my wife has watched some star trek with me over the years and she understands the key players and whatnot sisko worf the doctor etc but she has never understood my deep love of trek and what it means on a human level so i’m asking all of you what would be some standout episodes of each series to kind of showcase these human elements best  so far i’ve got episodes like darmok and measure of a man for tng and duet the visitor and far beyond the stars for ds9 i’m considering the enemy within and maybe let that be your last battlefield for tos that’s kind of the elements i’m looking to put front and center not sure stuff for voyager or enterprise would you guys help a fellow trekker please  thanks,best of star trek episodes sort of
2450,startrek,when you’ve been watching the show for years and you know the plot - and their mission - by heart it can be easy to forget how cleverly this episode is written in almost every episode the audience knows exactly what’s going on from beginning to end and it’s because we’re seeing the whole episode through the eyes of the senior command we start with picard’s log entry telling us what their mission is we get to see all the staff meetings the mission briefings etc but in this episode - and this is the part you can easily forget if you’ve been watching this for 25 years like i have - the audience knows almost nothing about what’s going on for almost the entire episode the ship is near the cardassian borderthere’s some escape pod they need to get and there’s a lot of secrecy about who’s in itpicard needs a certified pilotlaforge is doing some kind of strange “tests” involving phaser fire on a shuttlecraft and he doesn’t appreciate observations that it looks like they’re faking damage to a fleeing vesselthere’s an injured cardassianthat’s about it it’s really a mystery to the audience what’s going on and that’s because we’re seeing the mission through the eyes of the junior officers all of whom are only told whatever they need to know to carry out their assigned tasks it’s only at ensign sito’s mission briefing that we really find out what’s going on that’s more than halfway through the episode it’s very atypical for a trek episode but extremely appropriate for this one,lower decks the tng episode is brilliantly written
2451,startrek,a small green alien that only fred can see  it’s just too much  and the line “i guess i just suck” or whatever it was  vomitorium i really do apologize for sounding so negative but i’m a life-long moderate+ star trek fan and watching this show out of obligation is wrecking my head  everybody’s crying all the time they put a precocious ‘tween in charge of their starship and the whole crew seem to think that the chain of command is just a suggestion who are they making this show for,this “gray” character in discovery is like “gazoo” in the flintstones
2452,startrek,ok so the discovery was boarded and osyraa took over but why didnt tilly just activate a command level override to protect the ship and lock it down the moment she knew something was up that way osyraa would never have gotten her hands on the shipi know its probably a plot point for the next episode but it seems like such a plot hole for me,one thing i dont understand discovery 3x11
2453,startrek,so i just decided to start watching the franchise considering netflix has a seemingly large portion of it and i just finished the og series i have to say it leaves a lot to be desired despite planting the seeds of a good franchise and i felt like doing a write up of what i liked and disliked its enjoyable enough but its certainly a product of its timesill start off with some things i really like:* spock is a great character when odd stuff happens to make him laugh or show other emotions you actually have a sense that this is unnatural probably the best character in the series* bones is also pretty great hes kind of the heart of the enterprise and even though you dont always agree with his ideas you understand where his opinions come from i really liked the episode where he got the terminal disease and married the alien woman i was kinda hoping the two did just go off and have him retire what happened to that disease anyway dangling plot thread unless i missed something* the episode where they test the computer as the new ship controller was actually really funny because it called kirk out how he always sends himself spock and bones instead of crewmen like a normal military mission would be obviously this is what happens cuz its tv but it would make it a bit more realistic if he wasnt the vanguard 24/7* uhura is by far the best female as she actually does important stuff i recently rewatched an episode of comicbook men where her actress visited and it was interesting hearing that she almost quit but was asked to stay by martin luther king jr* young george takei that is all* i also enjoy the general premise of the series even if its just to allow for an indefinite episodic storylinenow lets get into some issues i have with it:* first a small complaint i have is the general lack of military-esque things this is supposed to be a military ship and checkov has a beatles bowl cut i dont know why but that small detail bothers me so much at least his russia obsession is amusing theres also a large lack of competency when people fight on the show so thats not so fun to watch* just about every kirk/random woman dynamic is annoying and repetitive the only one i found endearing was his native american wife/baby momma and the first few love interests werent that bad but most of the latter ones are just intolerable most of those episodes can be summarized by kirk and co find bad people kirk seduces alien woman betraying the woman saves the day and they must abandon their spark despite their feelings its so boring and i hate it remember that time an alien sabotaged the ship just to makeout with kirk haha yeah* american/earthly parallels this would have been interesting if it was once or twice but its happened like five times and its so horribly contrived also the intimate detail kirk had about the cowboy time period was so stupid spock i could believe but that was a pretty ridiculous episode while were on the topic the one with abraham lincoln was also not too great that entire storyline would have been amazing if lincoln was replaced with a made up galactic or interplanetary war hero/general but it being an american president is just so so so lazy and frustrating* unsatisfying endings some of these episodes just leave you thinking so that was it wtf to name a few: the one where kirks wife just dies pretty much anytime they encounter romulans when they just let the alien who stole a shuttle go cuz his people were dead and the episode where klingons arm some primitive people that last one in particular was super upsetting because everything was absolutely unresolved did they really just say oh well guess the prime directive was right haha and leave the planet that doesnt even make any sense* the womens outfits this just bothers me theyre not practical at all and in the first few episodes its like some of the womens only job is to attend to the captain i dont get this one at all also the episode where theyre eating dinner and keep telling the ambassador shes beautiful is very awkward and plain uncomfortable to be honest* technology like bones little scanner is just ridiculous this is another of those product of its time things but i just roll my eyes when he waves it over someone for 2 seconds and makes a thorough medical analysis the phrase hes dead jim will haunt me foreverall in all i think the series sets up a good universe for the future series and introduces some good characters im looking forward to watching the rest of the franchise after i power through the animated episodes next what is the general consensus on the best series worst,new star trek watcher thoughts on the original
2454,startrek,for the last weeks i have been trying to find a star trek episode however i don’t remember which series it belongs to i am sure that it isn’t tospicard or discovery because i have never watched thosethe episode i am trying to find was about a 2230’s ship that crashed and was found laterall help will be greatly appreciated i am sorry if the request is strange or too easy but i haven’t been able to find this episode and it’s really bugging me,help me find an episode

2463,startrek,a while back i made a post asking why chakotay episodes are so boring a few people told me that season 7’s shattered was the exception and i’m happy to say they were right shattered is a fantastic episode i think the reason it works so well is because it’s not just a chakotay episode- it’s a chakotay and janeway episode chakotay’s character works best when he’s interacting with others and his bond with janeway is my favorite because they have such a great relationship even when separated by 7 years they still are able to bond and trust each other and that love is shown here so well shattered also works because it’s an episode that relies on series continuity which voy typically lacks this is the one episode that really rewards you for watching everything and sticking by the series for 7 seasons side note i’m still bitter they didn’t become a couple- it was already written all you had to do was make it canon writers this isn’t even a case of the time period because it was a m/f relationship- there was no reason they couldn’t become a thing seven and chakotay is bs i’m a multishipper so i like most ships but that one and spock/uhura i just cannot enjoy respect to those that do though,why voy’s ‘shattered’ works as a chakotay episode

2476,startrek,i understand how dangerous time travel is  and why the federation would want to ban it  but what right do they have to impose that ban on the whole galaxy  and having one law or treaty that says you cant do something no matter the situation is too rigid  the use of time travel should be judged like prime direction violations  on a case by case basis  if the temporal accord had been around in the 23rd century do you think kirk would have sat on his hands and said oh i want to stop earth from being annihilated by an alien probe  but i cant because of the temporal accord  of course not he would have gone back in time anyway   why because it is the right thing to dobut according to the temporal accord kirk should have been immediately thrown in jail  even though he didnt alter the timeline  then there was that one guy who traveled from the kelvin timeline and into the future  who the federation let die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe  because of the temporal accord  when rules and laws becomes so rigid that they are willing to sacrifice people like that then they have become too rigid  there should be reasonable exceptions for the use of time travel  also does the federation plan on forcing this accord on everyone in the galaxy  who gave them the right to do that  what about aliens who use time travel but with the consent of their people and they dont effect the history of the federation or anyone else  are starfleet ships going to show up over their planet and force them to sign the temporal accord  that would be tyrannical  that said those who do use time travel as a weapon against others should be dealt with  and should not be tolerated  the temporal accord does that by prohibiting time travel regardless of the situation  which is way to rigid  if the federation cant be reasonable with its laws and treaties then it should expect members to just outright ignore them and non members to refuse to sign them  that being said their should time travel watchdogs who track malicious use of time travel while almost ignoring non malicious use of time travel  and each incident should be judged on a case by case basis  if they cant do this then they become a tyrannical organization and something that should be opposed also notice how the federation ignores the temporal accord when its inconvenient  if they were to follow it to the letter then discoverys crew would be in the brig  but they want their spore drive so they let a group of time travlers roam free  risking a temporal war if the other factions find out about it  so they dont even follow the temporal accord when it benefits them to not do so  but letting a man die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe that didnt benefit them to break the temporal accord so they didnt  but discoverys spore drive does so they will break the temporal accord to use it  so they are hypocritesso the bottom line is if they cant be sane and judge time travel use like prime directive violations on a case by case basis then they are the bad guys  so let me know what you think in the comments,i am not a fan of the temporal accord
2477,startrek,i dont know when prodigy is suppose to be out but as live action goes we might not see anything for a year plus i think picard is getting close to start shooting season 2 and strange new worlds is still in preproduction same with section 31 we might get some short treks but nothing substantial probably until this time 21 this will be the longest draught since the time when discovery premiered,when discovery s3 is over there wont be trek on tv for a long time
2478,startrek,the whole episode is just fucking gold the scene where picard teaches nuria about how we are not gods the arrow scene-then shoot the last scene: so we will you have taught us there is nothing beyond our reach not even the starsthis episode is just beautiful had me in tears at the end and i dont even cry watching sad films yet star trek episodes like this always makes me tear up,who watches the watchers is a true masterpiece

2485,startrek,lets say that the terran empire didnt fall  and kirk wasnt able to influence spock to start a revolution   what would a 32nd century terran empire look like  they would probably have hand held torture devices that could torture a room full of people  hell they probably would have invented high tech planetary torture machines  and anyone who didnt comply with the empire had those show up in orbit over their planet  it would make a 24th century cardassian prison look like a picnic  so what do you think a 32nd century terran empire would be like  let me know in the comments,what would a 32nd century terran empire be like

2487,startrek,hiso the feedback on twitter and reddit is almost 100 per cent positive with people raving about minor points like seeing actors out of make up and good uniforms   however on rt and imdb the audience reviews are predominantly 1/10 writing about poor plotlines and over actingcan anyone explain this to me,discrepancies between discovery reviews on here/twitter/imdb/rotten tomatoes

2494,startrek,so i was watching deep impact yesterday and it made me wonder what would the united federations of planets do if a primitive civilization was going to be wiped out soon by a meteorite what is their policy on that,hypothetical question
2495,startrek,like we all know where sulu sits but sometimes he isn’t there same goes for uhura etc like wouldn’t it make sense to show all that the cast as much as they can,in tos yeh don’t they have full/main crew on the deck
2496,startrek,it definitely wasn’t heard by that child in the simulation but everyone heard that song that helped them pinpoint the burn and they get to the planet andthere’s nothing to do with it there maybe next week did the writers forget,what about that song spoilers
2497,startrek,such as character or planet names that the actors read differently and then pronounced differently during recording why do people mostly notice sensors when thats how its spelled its like how pronouncing actor as acter is the accepted way but using the long o is like an archaic proper way to describe it its not like datas name where one version is actually correct its like data as the plural of datum which can go either way depending on how proper you want to sound or what youre used to hearing,of all of the varied pronunciation in star trek
2498,startrek,i’m watching star trek enterprise for the first time and i’m loving it so far i’m fixing to watch the star trek tv series in chronological order,please don’t tell me spoilers does season 4 the last season of enterprise end properly or is the last episode have a cliffhanger ending due to the cancellation

2502,startrek,so this recent episode of discovery has given us who and what caused the burn and a lot of people are not amazed by it but what i think is that the burn isnt the big reveal as we are thought to believe but in fact the federation has been infiltrated by the chain the burn happened the same time in another alternate universe where the federation has crumbled but being how admiral archer has help win the temporal cold war the federation has bought some time to exist i think in the temporal war the federation has lost badly and as a result this was their ultimate fate to be no more some how in this future dilithum would be its down fall because if they could not destroy earth in the temporal cold war they could destroy what is the federation as a whole none of its key planets are in it and even so the klingons arent even mentioned as to which gives hint they too have suffered from a loss of that war being how the orions are causing havoc i think someone has helped altered events to make sure the federation would be obsolete but the error they made was dilithumnow i think admiral vance and book are working with the chain and that is why discovery has been compromised because they have planted devices to help track the ship and its capabilities to osyraa how come she knows discovery has a spore drive how come she knew where discovery was also why has book been so keen on joining starfleet i think book and vance was feeding information to her behind their backs the admiral also has been very hesitant on finding out the cause of their burn  this also begs the question or even a trip down memory lane as to when micheal found discovery gergiou knew something was up with her and when she beamed back to discovery she was giving her the cold shoulder lets add on to the fact that  saru and tilly suspected something off with her when she got back a year can be a long time but when youre an adult a year isnt very long to let go on something or someone i suspect micheal isnt who she is and shes something else maybe the grudge  i would also like to add on about what happened to georgiou she needed to go back in time because of her time traveling dilemma she started having her issues as soon as kovich interrogated her but she also knew something was up with the federation because how could they let something like the burn happen or even figure it out in 125 years also time travel is banned but who or what is keeping tabs on who or what time travels  lets also add who can detect who or what time travel my theory is this the federation is and was compromised by the chain but they were only able to do to altered events which made the federation lose the temporal war kovich is actually starfleet/section 31 who knew georgiou needed to be sent back to make sure she can give info on what was the fate of the federation 1000 years from where ever she was sent back to also micheal book and vance are not who they say they are i think discovery has to go back in time again to try and prevent some events from happening because all we know is that the chain has over taken the federation as whole by next episode,theories and speculation in disco
2503,startrek,hey allhere are some screenshots to comparewatching through ds9 for the first time and loving it i didnt see this posted when i searched the sub but i wanted to point out the parallel between the scene where odo gets turned into a human after being tried for killing another changeling its a pretty great parallel odo is more or less being created by the changelings as adam was by god in the bible except this case when trying to reach out the changeling doesnt reach back maybe this is an obvious and well-known reference but i didnt see anything about it and wanted to share,watching ds9 for the first time noticed a parallel between odo and the creation of adam in s04e25 spoilers

2512,startrek,major spoilers for the latest episode of discovery&amp;#x200b;yesterday we learned that at the center of the burn is a planet made of dilithium when the crew sees this somebody i cant remember who says something to the effect of this would solve the scarcity problem and everyone seems to think this solves the dilithium problem book even says the galaxy just got a whole lot smallernow obviously this is true for awhile but reliance on any non-renewable recourse is inherently a temporary solution assuming the entire planet is made of dilithium it should be easy to calculate how long this one planet will last but consider that the federation had many dilithium mining planets and those only lasted about 1000 years when you consider that for the early part of that time there were much fewer ships and the majority of the dilithium was coming from earths moon alone for the first 100 years this doesnt seem like a lot by the time of the burn the federation also included klingon space and likely cardassian and romulan space too thats a lot of dilithium and all 350 member wolds spend what 100 years trying to find an alternative and only one almost-solution was found that was deemed to dangerousand now its not just the federations supply of dilithium but the entire galaxys the federation is setting itself up to fail the entire galaxy knows that in x years there will be no more dilithium and everything will go back to the way it was even the spore drive needs dilithium crystals to carry powernow you may say but isnt that how our world works right now to which i say yes it is and look at where thats been taking us for the past century how hopeful is the average person about the state of the world in 100 years time plus the people of star trek have been shown to clearly understand the problems with this kind of dependence even in the days of enterpriseso my question is is this planet a solution at all or is it just a 1-200 year temporary fix remember im assuming 100% of the planet is pure dilithium but that planet didnt look purple and crystal-y to me,how much dilithium would it take to fix the scarcity issue
2513,startrek,so am i the only one who feels the burn being caused by whats essentially a kelpien childs emotional tantrum to be awfully anti climatic and disappointing all this build and mystery to just feel like it fizzled out for the federation v emerald chain plotend log,spoilers season 3
2514,startrek,heya sooo random question: are there any like resources on klingon mating practises or rituals in general from klingon society im currently planning on a fanfiction that may involve these sorts of things just curious if there is any as they seem to not list them at all in the official wiki but vulcan ones are shown probably because reason being the klingon one is too graphicstill im fine with whatever resources are recommendedthanks despite the whole question being weird unless its just me that thinks so 😅😅,any sources on klingon society
2515,startrek,im not bitter im just saying the ending of this episode reminded me of tngs rascals; except this ep was not as plausibleseriously thoughi wonder if maybe discovery shouldnt have found starfleet hq and had been forced to tackle a hostile galaxy with only the sphere ai and spore drive as their main advantage then it would make slightly more sense for them to constantly get *effortlessly* owned by scavengers and travelling salesmen with future tech and tactics,discovery in season 3 spoilers for s03e11 - sukal

2518,startrek,i was on trekmoviecom reading some comments by the trek fans  the comment was about jj abrams&amp;#x200b;a fan said it was good jj abrams got his karma for ditching star trek to go do star wars when he was still under contract by paramunt to do a trek 3 after into darknessthe fan said it was karma for jj abrams because the  disney trilogy has turned out to be a disaster and rise of skywalker  not only sort of bombed but became seen  as the worst star wars film the trek fan said this has hurt jj abrams remutation but he deserved it for jumping ship simply because star wars was more popular &amp;#x200b;please what do you trek fans on reddit think i do know trek fans sometimes feel differently on different  trek sites,did jj abrams get get what he deserved for leaving trek for star wars
2519,startrek,the character isnt written or portrayed even remotely offensively so does that just make her a deus ex machina  or does she still kinda qualify within the meta-narrative im not sure im using this term properly of the show  did roddenberry or have the actors spoken about this,do you think whoopi goldbergs character guinan i love her portrayal qualify as a magical negro trope
2520,startrek,so in the episode shore leave they encounter a planet that literally makes their dreams come to life  they later decide to make it into a resort  by tng era however people regularly have holodecks so is it still worth it  i think it maybe because in some ways is much better  for one you dont have to program it the planet just scans your mind for you to create what you want also a holodeck program is only as good as the programmer can make it there maybe flaws that the user sees that the programmer didnt  you get everything you want on the fantasy planethowever holodecks only act when you program to  the downside to the fantasy planet is it makes any you think come to life  try to clear your mind and you may run into the stay puff marshmallow man  not only that but it isnt just you who generates fantasies  anyone you are with or who is already there are doing it as well  so if someone dreams of a dinosaur watch out   in the episode we meet  yeoman tonia barrows who is kinkest person ever to join starfleet  her fantasy is for some medieval knight to show up fight to win her kidnap her and rip her dress off  she was the only one of this crew to have an abduction fetish but you get a whole ship load down and i think some really crazy stuff might start happening because it only takes one person to think of it if you want to read my review of shore leave you can do so here: ,the fantasy planet from shore leave better than the holodeck

2537,startrek,,star trek: discovery actor mary wiseman has a few choice words for body-shaming “haters”
2538,startrek,in the last episode of discovery the chain was able to beam aboard discovery and take over the ship  this scenario is easily avoided by putting transporter scramblers throughout the ship  also being able to quickly activate the self destruct or at the very least lock out control of the ship would be a good idea  also being able to quickly lock on to anyone who isnt part of the crew and beam them into space wold be another good option  they could also modify the artificial gravity so that it increases five or ten times for anyone who isnt part of the crew  that would neutralize a boarding party pretty easily  so why is their security always so horrible  let me know what you think in the comments,why dont federation ships have better security

2542,startrek,ive been vaguely into star trek for a while now but im starting to pay more attention to each episodemore times than i can count on my hand has the enterprise violated the prime directive in bith tos and tng respectively they make it seem like its a big deal to violate it yet do it so regularly with seemingly no consequencesis the prime directive more of a suggestion than a law,what are the actual repercussions of violating the prime directive

2546,startrek,i am coming into possession of a small sailboat oday 17 and i want to give it a name that implies both exploration and science i think i want to name her after a federation science vessel ive googled a bit but cant seem to find a list of names with episodes where i could see the ship in action   i understand piccards first assignment was a science vessel star gazer thats nice but a little too      i dont know something   at this stage of my life im done with war names and things that go pew pew pew i want to do what humans do best: explore star trek was a vision of humanity after we solved all our earthly distractions and we returned to what makes humans human: exploration and learning,need help naming a sailboat
2547,startrek,i have been watching trek series for a while started with enterprise and watching voyager now i like chronological order to be honest vulcan logic mentality started rubbing on my mind and i kind of started adopting it in my life think more logically and less with emotion anyone on similar boat,started thinking like vulcan
2548,startrek,for me its geopolitical trek ds9/game of thrones stuff ensemble casts focusing on people calling the shots on the political level the little people on the ground whose lives are profoundly affected by those decisions and anything in between as little of a status quo as possible hella consequences no reset button&amp;#x200b;what checks your boxes,what checks your boxes for a new trek series
2549,startrek,when the cardassians/dominion take over the station the minefield is said to be difficult to destroy since every mine replicates a new one if its neighbor mine detonates however when the minefield is ultimately destroyed in sacrifice of angels one phaser shot is enough to cause all mines to detonate in a chain reaction i know that their replicators have been deactivated by that time but if the chain reaction happens that quickly and affects the whole minefield how should the whole thing have been able to work at all one shot would have been enough to cause that massive explosion and due to the extremely fast chain reaction there would have been no time for any mine to replicate a new one before it detonates maybe i am missing something but can somebody please explain how this was supposed to work,question about the minefield in ds9
2550,startrek,im doing my usual chronological overlap of tng and ds9 and noticed something funny in this episode dr crusher wants very badly to do an autopsy on this dead ferengi scientist but the relatives wont allow it picard says it has something to do with their death rituals and theyre adamant about it later beverly adds the body cant be violated before its buriedthis happens *after* ds9 in the episode nagus establishes that dead ferengi are desiccated divided into pieces and sold as memorabilia i cant help but wonder if the issue here is that the writers are unfamiliar with ds9s developments of ferengi custom or if were meant to notice the enterprise crews unfamiliarity with ferengi custom,tng s6e22: suspicions and the overlap between tng and ds9

2555,startrek,so i finally got around to watching all of discovery over the past couple of weeks that was the last trek show i hadn’t seen yet ok i haven’t seen any cartoons either but - anyway i was frankly not into the first season at all it was depressing did not feel like trek one bit was overly futuristic for a time period that was supposed to be before tos and i didn’t like any of the characters plus it was just too complicated and frankly not a fan of the plot and don’t get me started on those weird klingons lol like what was that anyway second season with the arrival of pike and slight change of tone and resolutions of certain discrepancies between the trek we know and that klingons back to normal tech explanations like holograms etc a slightly more positive vibe - i started to get into it in fact i’m really looking forward to strange new worlds i do miss lorca though - he was one thing i loved about season 1 i wish they brought back his prime universe version or something then season 3 arrived and wow just wow the future is incredible and i love that there is just nothing we can say about how it doesn’t fit with the rest of trek technology wise now because it’s just so far ahead i love that we’re seeing completely new territory in a way that makes sense the tone has gotten so much more positive and i’m really feeling the true trek vibes now so much emotion so much hope okay i’m not done i’m only at episode 6 so don’t spoil but so far amazing what are your thoughts,discovery season 3 - wow what a world
2556,startrek,this is soo werid that they dont have seatbelt in spaceships i was watching discovery ep 2 and all of them fall of their seat and the captain holding the chair so he dont fly like whyyy😂😂why they dont have seatbelt,seatbelt
2557,startrek,,voyager could have been in a worse situation
2558,startrek,,star trek: discovery 3x11 preview clip
2559,startrek,,how james bond inspired this underrated star trek episode
2560,startrek,i try to like discovery i really do im pumped that the universe finally has gay people its visually amazing and i have to remind myself that its star trek and not shakespeare it was always hokey predictable paper thin overacted and far fetched it was part of the charm but i dont know the emo speeches annoy me and the whole thing just feels just a little bit more remedial forced and shallow than usual i still watch theres definitely redeeming qualities but something just feels myeh,thoughts on discovery
2561,startrek,the farengi were used to demonstrate the foibles of capitalism but i feel like the star trek completely missed the boat im demonstrating one of the biggest issues with capitalism which is that its completely horrific for the environment in little green men quark exclaims in shock they irradiated their own planet in reaction to the testing of atomic bombs but this flies in the face everything farengi unrestricted resource exploitation would have been just as destructive to farenginar as nuclear war the idea that they would for some reason consider their own planet sacred and protect just seems bizarre i really wish it turned out that farenginar was not their original planet because they had completely destroyed their original world does anyone else feel like this was a huge missed opportunity,does anyone else wish the farengi were used more as an example for environmentalism

2563,startrek,i love seeing the cast of deadwood all over the star trek world when do we get a full deadwood cast series all of them on a ship and a super dark depressing raw show on hbo,deadwood trek
2564,startrek,so im watching tng again and something struck me in the episode where no one has gone before is it ever explained why warp 10 turned janeway and  tom into amphibians but does not occur in any other episode of any series i mention the tng episode above where they exceed warp 10 due to an engine malfunction there have also been a couple of times in tos where they exceed warp 10 but i chalk it up to them not knowing what they were doing at that point in the shows production and scotty claimed it to be impossiblei know transwarp theory was a thing supposed to exceed warp limits and faster than light speeds but didnt seem to take off due to its unreliability i never really watched voyager that much since its my least favourite but maybe im missing something and being dumb since i remember something about wacky dilithium being used; but the way the episode portrayed it was that warp 10 was near impossible dangerous and sped up your biology for some weird reason is this a plot hole or just something poorly explained in-universe,the warp 10 conundrum
2565,startrek,,i made a remix of pogos data &amp; picard today :
2566,startrek,,for the record i didn’t make this but i thought it should be here this might be my favorite star trek christmas songs yet

2569,startrek,,mary wiseman being body shamed on social media
2570,startrek,it was going to be called keeping up with the cardassians,til there was almost a ds9 spin-off starring kira nerys that would have focused on her friendship with dukat’s daughter tora ziyal
2571,startrek,,a star trek: nemesis pictorial sums up nemesis perfectly
2572,startrek,ive enjoyed many of the recent books but so many of them are focused on battles borg and tensions between different races and factions i want a book about aliens or exploration or a  strange new world recommendations,are there any tng/ds9 novels about exploration
2573,startrek,,i made a remix of pogos data &amp; picard today
2574,startrek,i dont know what i expected i think its just a star trek thing,i just finished watching star trek: enterprise and am moving onto tng and holy crap the soft core porn is even worse in tng
2575,startrek,,they massacred star trek
2576,startrek,,they masacred star trek
2577,startrek,this year i started watching star trek finally ive went through tos tng 10 movies and now im halfway into the first season of ds9 as far as i understand the show we have met a lot of super psychic power aliens some who are on the same level with us and a lot of civilizations that i cannot believe that have achieved warp drive am i wrong if i understand it correctly the prime directive states that first contact shall happen only after a civilization has achieved warp drive you mean to tell me that random aliens that live in small villages are capable of interstellar travel,prime directive and warp drive
2578,startrek,mine would be:espresso double black no sugar hot,what hot beverage would be your most frequent command to a replicator
2579,startrek,ive been having a think over what makes each show good but of course each is not without their shortcomings for example:tos:  strength: fascinating stories interesting characters willing to take chances  weakness: product of its time re: sexism some episodes are absolute campetc,what would you say are the primary strengths and weaknesses of each st show
2580,startrek,,why doesnt the federation incorporate design language and elements from other species into the appearance of their ships
2581,startrek,we know enterprise was the first warp capable ship but in a  tas episode he says thats the old bonaventure first ship to have a warp drive and in beyond the franklin was the first starship with a warp 4 engine can you believe itagreed nx 01 came after the bonaventure and bonaventure could have had a warp 2 or 3 engine but i wonder about franklin my theories are 1 uss franklin nx-362 came before nx-01 but she was an experiment of another starfleet not united earth starfleet which would mean she was of the tos referenced espa however this would contradict the uss prefix2 the kelvin universe didnt actually branch out of prime universe 3 scotty is on methamphetamine,scotty is on methamphetamine
2582,startrek,so i was wondering if there are going to be any more episodes for st:disi looked in wikipediathere is one for christmas eve: sukal one for new years eve: the good of the people directed by jonathan frakes  the last one is on january 7  if i was a teenager now a day id have a problem do i open presents or watch st:dis  if anyone has any contacts id appreciate it if you could tell jonathan frakes if he could get a st:pic or any star trek seriesto show a new episode on september 1 2021 id love it,there will be a star trek episode for christmas eve
2583,startrek,i was just randomly thinking ‘what would i be like and doing right now in the alternate universe’ then i wondered about what would be happening right now if our timeline is pretty similar to theirs then we shouldn’t be in a major war i wonder how corona is going over there does anyone have any idea,terran empire
2584,startrek,i can only imagine how much more powerful the borg are by the 32nd century  that is assuming they havent been totally wiped out  it would be interesting if discovery ran into a borg ship  the 32nd century dominion would also be interesting  considering that discovery has jumped half way across the galaxy several times im surprised they havent run into the borg,it would be interesting to see 32nd century borg
2585,startrek,i know i know its in a few days  close enoughalso i prefer the *xifan hol* system of writing klingon because then i can screamqismas quc dagajjaj,qismas quc dagajjaj
2586,startrek,,are there no bathrooms in the entire federation ive seen every episode except for a few of the original series yet i havent seen one toilet what about a toothbrush
2587,startrek,hello i started watching star trek chronologically every episode im still in ent but looking ahead i am wondering if i will watch the animated series or not just wondering if people generally feel it is worth the time to watch or not thanks for any input,tas: worth the time investment to watch
2588,startrek,the captains log,what did spock find in the toilet
2589,startrek,,adira sucks as a character
2590,startrek,they let out a collective sigh,what happens when an entire borg cube is exasperated
2591,startrek,he was so adorable in this episode and he’s always been awesome but so much more in this episode i forever will clap like he does during the game that is all,ds9 take me out to the holo suite made me fall in love with rom
2592,startrek,why do so few planets in star trek have planetary defenses  weve seen a few planets that had decent planetary defenses  the planetary shield and defense grid over earth in discovery was impressive  but for the most part few planets have planetary defenses  why is that  considering the federations history of war and conflict for an organization devoted to peace they do get into a lot of wars you would think their member worlds would have planetary defensesa planetary defense grid is much cheaper then building a fleet of starships  because they dont need warp drive just a few thrusters to keep them from falling out of orbit their much smaller then most ships and they arent used often so the energy cost is low  a planetary shield is an even better option if you have the power and technology  but even without a shield a planetary defense grid can take out a fleet of ships  another option is mines  self replicating mines if you have the technology  you could build the mines in space and when your expecting unwanted guests you could have them maneuver into position or beam them into position  that way you have several layers of defenses between a fleet of enemy ships and the planet  ground to space cannons are also a good option  so that even if ships get past the orbital defenses they still get blown out of the sky from the cannons on the groundmost of these planetary defenses are cheap  mines and orbital weapon platforms are easy to build  a planetary shield would be more difficult but possible  with the proper planetary defenses you could hold off the entire klingon or romulan fleet  maybe even both  so considering the federations history of war they should start equipping their member worlds with effective planetary defense systems  the dominion war would have turned out differently if most federation worlds had effective planetary defenses  the dominon fleet would have been wiped out over batazed instead of conquering the planet  so the federation really help their member worlds defend themselves better  that they are prepared for future wars,planetary defenses
2593,startrek,just watched space seed oops whats you favorite screw up,biggest mistake by a captain
2594,startrek,from star trek: voyager - s04e14 “message in a bottle”i may have watched this episode more times than any other episode purely because of the uss prometheus so the prometheus it was a beautiful ship both internally and externally any expanded media stuff set on that ship,need more of the uss prometheus
2595,startrek,what i always thought was that the enterprise during its five years mission travelled across a tiny portion of space regarding the size of the federation which expands in the alpha and beta quadrants and the size of the klingon empire that could even be more largertherefore it could be understandable that mutated klingons seen as misfits would be sent altogether to the same part of the galaxy they would still be part of the empire working to continue its expansion but far from the normal klingons as if they were sent into exile that would explain why the enterprise ran into the same faces and also it would explain why we dont get to see any mutated klingon in discoverythat said its my personal hypothesis it would be great to see those old school klingons at least once in strange new worlds i hope the writers will provide a good tie in between discovery and tos in that matter,writers working on strange new worlds could provide an explanation for why the only klingons that are shown to us in tos are mutated klingons
2596,startrek,bonus points for le forge data team up episodes,best la forge centered episodes
2597,startrek,i dont mean this as a criticism at all all tv shows have to have a fallback that they can use whenever they have a need for a storywriters strike all the main cast get stuck in a lift and reminisce via flashbacksthe simpsons have a sideshow bob episode with great regularityit seems that wherever the tng writers needed a bit of an easy week they would just invent another  data prototype its a tradition im very fond of assuming an ongoing supply of new episodes what is the limit is there a limit does the mirror universe have the same data clones,is it fair to say that if tng had another couple of seasons they would have discovered *another* sibling of datas and another assuming the show ran from 1987 until now how many soong boys would they be up to now what would they be called
2598,startrek,warning: this is a somewhat a long winded storyso i call myself an avid trekker since the early-mid 90s i was about 5-6 years old when tng ended on tv and i do remember watching the episodes on tv when they were brand new i was somewhat into ds9 and a little bit of voyager as those shows continued on tv and seen every movie in theatres from first contact to star trek beyond enjoyed all of it of course i watched every tos movies and enjoyed them as well i never did get into star trek enterprise when that was on tv or didnt watch discovery when that premiered a couple of years ago i did watch star trek picard which i loved so i got an idea of how things will look in discovery for the most part so as the title says is now a good time to start watching or will i not enjoy it because of the connection i still have with tng era and crew,as a huge tng fan is now a good time to watch star trek discovery
2599,startrek,,hi guys heres my dad and is star trek tree this year super proud to carry on the tradition : 
2600,startrek,my word this episode left me feeling raw considering the isolation of this year and the same sense of trying to keep it all together until vaccines are rolled out  almost up there with ds9s the visitor and tngs inner light but only because of the shared anguish of this year of hell,voy one s4e25 is 2020 in a nutshell
2601,startrek,,not a huge fan of nemesis but i love this scene
2602,startrek,i was just watching tng/encounter at farpoint and i didnt realize they had a lt torres on the enterprise at least the first episode i was wondering any chance he related to lt torres on voyager,was torres on tng related to torres on voyager
2603,startrek,on the discovery we have seen from the beginning the laboratory for the spore drive stamets room in the third episode of season 1 lorca beams with michael to the spore room and calls it a laboratory but we haven’t seen the normal engine room for the warpdrive or either the chief-engineer there is for sure a chief engineer who is not stamets because reno got one time a task from him to fulfill i have to say i am really pissed that we have now 3 seasons done and we haven’t seen the main engine room or the chief engineer they don’t even talk about it in any situationare the writers forgetting this are they aware of this merely fact but we can waste a complete episode to jump to books homeplanet nobody wanted to see this is ok,main engine-room uss discovery
2604,startrek,q: ”not mapping stars or charting galaxies but the endless possibilities of existence”picard: “q what is it you’re trying to tell me”q leans in towards picard as if he is about to whisper something but doesn’t what do you think it was,in “all good things pt2” what was q trying to say to picard
2605,startrek,,how common are planetwide tragedies like the bajoran occupation outside federation space
2606,startrek,as we know production of a revival to tos was haltered in favour of making a film after the success of star wars etc i wanted to know what everyones thoughts were on this decision in retrospect would you rather have seen a new series of the original cast or are you happy with the films we got staring the original cast i cant help but think if the series had been made then perhaps we would not have got tng or ds9 etc or perhaps not the tng or ds9 we know and love today regardless of this in retrospect were the films good enough to forget about a series with the original cast perhaps lasting several seasons i personally am happy with what we got because tng is my favourite series but i cant help but think what could have been,star trek: phase ii
2607,startrek,,star trek rebel uniforms
2608,startrek,,trek renegade uniform
2609,startrek,they inherited the ds9 station from the bleak cardassiansyet in the 7 years they been there near as i can tell not one person repainted a black wall brighterwhy would they have left the station so dark and dreary,ds9why did they leave the station so bleak
2610,startrek, is the fact that until balance of terror nobody in the federation knew that the romulans were related to the vulcans  no human had ever seen a romulan before so they didnt know they had the same appearance  the romulan commanders appearance was even a surprise to spock  it was a major part of the backstory that during the federation-romulan war from a century before there were no visual communications and they only talked by radiowhat gets me is that back during enterprise archers crew had even heard romulans speak untranslated  in the reboot movies alternate-uhura could even speak romulan -- all three dialects of it -- and stated she was about the only human who could distinguish spoken romulan from spoken vulcanconsidering that tpol was a native vulcan and sato could also speak vulcan without the assistance of the ut which she herself could program anyway -- nobody thought to mention that these sight-unseen hostile aliens were speaking a nearly indistinguishable version of a language that was spoken by earths only alien allies of the moment  and the fact of that significant similarity did not get passed down through the war which was a major inciting incident for the founding of the federationi mean i can talk my way around most star trek plot holes  just not that one,a star trek plot hole i cant get past
2611,startrek,i just finished rewatching mirror mirror which i consider to be my favourite episode of tos i know the likes of the city on the edge of forever are big fan favourites i was wondering what everyones favourite episode was and why also if anyones favourite episode is one that usually isnt mentioned can you tell me which one and why,favourite episode of tos
2612,startrek,it always bothered me a little that miles and keiko never talked about how they were both taken over by non-corporeal entities not even a hey now were even,tng power play followed by ds9 the assignment for the full obrien experience
2613,startrek,i know dilithium is scarce because of the burn  but they still have really advanced technology  and apparently their ships have cloaking devices  so i say find a small ship and go hide out on an asteroid or in deep space  if its cloaked the chances of someone finding you is really low  and if your ship isnt moving its not using much power  and there are other power sources then antimatter which requires dilithium  and with replicators you wont run out of food or water  you could also grow your own food and conserve replicator energy  so with technology that advanced it shouldnt be mad max in space even if the federation were to fall  even with 24th century technology running and hiding from an oppressive regime or space pirates and raiders would not be difficult  but with cloaking technology it would be even easier  so let me know what you think,why is the 32nd century mad max in space
2614,startrek,,in the final episode of season 2 of discovery the fight with michelle yeoh against leland was does in a spinning room to simulate the gravity failing michelle yeoh also does her own stunt work
2615,startrek,were they celebrities does startrek have celebrities what are celebrities like in other galactic cultures whats fan-culture like in the 24th century  was westley constantly writing fanfic about picard and his mom gross and if they werent celebrities what were they because they obviously had media attention and some kind of public voice were they like our astronauts and renowned scientists is picard the bill gates or steven hawking of his daywhat do you think,discussion: we all know that startrek captains were renowned but what were they to the public eye
2616,startrek,meet picardavroshacked together from different models 3d printed and hand painted very roughly never tried it before daftest thing ive printed but i think it works,wanted a unique present for a big fan of both star trek and doctor who

2618,startrek,,brent spiner in the role that made him famous
2619,startrek,just finished terra firma pt 2i can say without a doubt she is fierce she has more growth than most characters in the series from a ruthless terran to so much more her fierce devotion to her beliefs is what is truly impressivethe terran empire is strong but is clearly destined to fall it is evident that with the new and improved georgiou at the helm they may have a chance she proves to be even more badass than the terrans who simply rely on cruelty as a cop outmost importantly she travelled to a mirror universe made herself at home and proved indispensable in the current time and 900+ years in the futuremy main worry is how will discoveries white bread approach keep them alive without georgiou willing to do what needs to be done,so georgiou is easily one of the most badass people in all of star trek
2620,startrek,,have the inner light lore and lal been soft retconned out of star trek

2626,startrek,he always talks about how peaceful he is but if anyone disrespects his rank he threatens to hurt them which is extra screwed up because he’s a trained fighter examples in “learning curve” and “year of hell” part 2 i think in the episode “living witness” while his fake character is torturing that guy he says “i’m a man of peace” and it always makes me laugh because it’s such an accurate depiction of his real character,chakotay is a huge hypocrite
2627,startrek,ill start&amp;#x200b;harry kim - aggressively lame&amp;#x200b;seriously this dude goes out of his way to be lame every time you think hes going to say something sensible he opens his mouth and says something incredibly lame instead its no wonder he never got promoted i was seriously rooting for him for a while but it just got exhausting not that he didnt have his moments of brilliance but they tended to be the exception not the rule,describe a star trek character in two words
2628,startrek,the one where every single character except trip openly condones and defends slavery and they dont even have the prime directive as an excuse this episode baffles mearcher blaming the enslaved persons suicide on trip is the most insane and unforgivable thing a starfleet captain has ever done including janeway risking lives for her holographic boyfriend solidified enterprise as worst star trek series and trip the only remotely likable character on it for me,enterprise cogenitor is the worst episode in all of star trek
2629,startrek,what is the budget for season 3 per episode,discovery - season 3 budget
2630,startrek,so ive been a star trek fan as long as i can remember as i get older i keep re-watching the series i see an occasional issue however like the whole bridge crew going on away missions but thats another thingone issue that i never understood even as a kid was in chain of command part 1 its like you have a heavy-duty hazardous mission the stakes are huge what do we do send an aging ship captain a cmo and a security officerbut where were the special forces does starfleet not have an equivalent to the seals okay so it was some highly classified material but spec-ops guys have high clearance for exactly that reasonso whats up with that because i saw no valid in-universe explanation as to why they sent picard crusher and worfthoughts,discussion: chain of command tng s6 e10

2634,startrek,so a friend and i were discussing this yesterday and here was my response id say not as badly as you might think at first remember she was very skilled at kissing the admirals ass and probably sucking his d*ck but i try not to think about that so im betting she landed on her feet and got herself a command within 7 years agree,how badly do you think riker damaged shelbys career in the wake of wolf 359
2635,startrek,,spoilers star trek discoverys episode this week has a scene filmed in my home city
2636,startrek,is it because of the so called trek fatigue after ent that still needs time re-ignite through newer seriesor is star trek just much harder to depict in a video game setting vs sws hack-slash-and-shoot straightforwardnessor because of cbs / paramount sorry i still dont quiet get who really owns the prime universe of star trek have some prohibitive licensing rules that make development difficulti am aware of some of the old games but i believe none of them stirred much attention at all i for one really hope someone can develop a mass effect rpg game for star trekps please dont debate me on whether sto is aaa lol,other then sto why there arent more star trek aaa games
2637,startrek,with every added appearance that the borg has had it demystifies the species in their first episode the enterprise couldn’t defeat them q had to intervene to save them after every single episode where the federation manages to defeat them it makes them seem less and less powerful i suppose i-borg was an alright episode and best of both worlds was important to sisko and picard’s character arc but even then i think that’s pushing it what do you guys think,unpopular opinion: the borg should have been one-time villains
2638,startrek,so in the st universe there are hundreds of species we have been introduced to what are some of the species you would have liked to see be used or developed more,most underused alien species

2641,startrek,asking for both in-universe and show watching reasons im watching ds9 for the first time having caught sporadic episodes of next generation on tv and seen a number of the movies in ds9 they rarely announce set phasers to stun or to kill so in action scenes its hard to tell are they killing stunning tickling or whatspecifically in one episode i just started season 3 so first two seasons spoilers- fairly mild kira and obrien raid a cardassian prison camp and shoot multiple guards being in open combat i assumed these guards were killed later in the episode tribunal o brien stated he has not killed any cardassians since the war is he lying or had he genuinely stunned the guards how long does a stun last i understand the diplomatic reasons to stun rather than kill but isnt it tactically riskymy other reason for asking is if youre being shot at do you have any ability to determine the level of firepower youre being hit with short of checking vitals on someone who has been hit do you have any indication whether their weapons are set to lethal mode,is there any way to tell a phasers setting ds9 season 2 spoilers mild
2642,startrek,that mr spock has been strait forward an honest in the tos serries  he even makes a vulcan joke about it while being quite serious and honest  his first name is unpronounceable  yes quite seriously thats the meaning of his first name  when translated to human  unpronounceable spock is his first and last name in human  it was a joke from his human mother as most vulcan names she was unable to pronounce  spock simply kept that a secret as its a kind of vulcan humor,people have always messed with spocks first name the truth is
2643,startrek,im not sure how gender identity was understood when this episode came out but since gender identity is becoming a less taboo thing the talk about and its importance to society is better understood it surprised me how respectfully this idea is treated in the showif you havent watched it lately it was my first time today the basic premise is that there is an androgenous race that has no genders since in the past the have evolved to be a single gender however some people are still born with gender tendencies such as male/female feelings and identities these people are hunted down socially punished and ostracized until they publicly admit that they are non-gendered like everyone else one such person self identifies as female and she is put on trial for it some very interesting quotes arising from that scene:sorin: i am tired of lies i am female i was born that way i have had those feelings those longings all of my life it is not unnatural i am no sick because i feel this way i do not need to be helped i do not need to be cured what i need and what all of those who are like me need is your understanding and your compassion we have not injured you in any way and yet we are scorned and attacked all because we are different what we do is no different from what you do we talk and laugh we complain about work and we wonder about growing old we talk about our families and we worry about the future and we cry with each other when things seem hopeless all of the loving things that you do with each other that is what we do and for that we are called misfits and deviants and criminals what right do you have to punish us what right do you have to change us what makes you think you can dictate how people love each otherthe responsei congratulate you sorin your decision to admit you perversion makes it much more likely that we can help youi could go on about this but ill stop there so i dont write out the whole script of the episode,just watching tng 5x17 - the outcast and it seems to me that star trek was ahead of its time with respect to gender identities
2644,startrek,ive been rewatching discovery  just for the hell of it  and i think that starfleets tactics at the battle of the binary stars was inept  they should have fallen back and regrouped with the federation fleet  engaging a superior enemy with one ship when you know they have backup on the way is foolish  i know they were trying to protect federation planets  but the best way they could defend the federation is to fall back and regroup  even if civilians get massacred in the long run they would be in a better position to win the war  leaving a few colonies undefended is better then losing the entire federation  the best approach is to fall back to the federation core worlds and defend them with most of their ships    let the klingons come to them  there are advantages to adopting a siege mentality when faced with a superior force  with less territory to defend they would have a much stronger perimeter  they would be leaving many federation worlds out to be massacred but in the long run its the best strategy to win the war,starfleets tactics at the battle of the binary stars was inept

2649,startrek,i hate michael burnham  but what i dont get is why she is blamed for the klingon war  she did mutany and tried to fire on the klingons  but she was stopped and thrown in the brig  so how the hell is she to blame for the war  also a life sentence seems like a really harsh sentence for mutiny  especially considering she didnt actually accomplish anything  also considering the klingons history any sane person should have realized the likely outcome of a confrontation would be war no matter who fired first  also i have to wonder if she would have been punished if she had fired and the klingons backed off  if someone were to mutiny and stop a war would they still be thrown in the brig  regardless you have to give burnham credit  she mutinied knowing it would ruin her career  because she beloved it was the right thing to do  she didnt mutiny for selfish reasons  and that should have been considered before she was handed a life sentence  they make her out to be a monster when she was just trying to stop a war  so i think blaming her for the klingon war is ridiculous,why is michael burnham blamed for the klingon war
2650,startrek,i have recently started watching ds 9  season 2 starting so no spoilers please  i have been wondering why didnt voyager just make a beeline to the bajoran wormhole in the gamma quadrant and just coast back home in the alpha quadrant,why uss voyager didnt use the bajoran wormhole

2659,startrek,hey trekkersmy son has been really anxious for a number of reasons during these covidy times so at his request i started reading to him again before bed we hit a couple of sci-fi novels and he likes trek any trek series he might enjoy  we started to read the vanguard series he picked it off amazon because he likes tos but it meanders a bit it being the first of a series i guess and adult themes namely a couple of adult relationships and the vulcan officer who was sexually traumatized i can skip over some of that you dont want your dad reading it to you but it gets tough to edit on the fly particularly when it is integral to the plot  i never really got into the trek novels so i am not sure where to start hes a budding engineer so maybe the sce novels might be good if it includes some good old-fashioned problem-solving,recommend novels for my 12 year-old

2667,startrek,i just started watching voyager a month ago and got to one of the better reviewed episodes of the show: s3e9-10 the two parter futures end its a pretty solid episode but the ending bugs me  time travel by flying around the sun was well known back in the tos era 100 years prior its a major plot point in *star trek iv: the voyage home* for example  so why didnt voyager just slingshot around the sun while they were near earth to get back to their right place in time/space  i guess captain braxtons ship mightve fired on them but they already defeated it before by reflecting its weapon couldnt they just do that again and save themselves 4 years,voy futures end: why didnt they slingshot around the sun
2668,startrek,,hear me out and share your thoughtssanta is a q

2677,startrek,although it was never branded or advertised that way it seems like it would fit the definition - a group of series that share history characters and frequent crossovers,to what degree if any would you say star trek is a cinematic universe in the way that the mcu or star wars is

2681,startrek,personally i think this episode was great and setup one of the most sincere relationships in star trek most star trek relationships feel forced but this one actually felt like two people who genuinely needed each otherthey were both very unique individuals and they both felt isolated from the rest of the crew as a result of that uniqueness there was a pervasive loneliness in their characterizations that only seem to subside when they were on screen togetherits a shame they dropped the ball on this not just once but twice,voyagers someone to watch over me setup one of the biggest disappointments in star trek
2682,startrek,sorry if its a stupid question and i think there are a lot of post similar i love tos and tng the most i quit dis before the end of the first season because i really disliked the protagonist and the lack of meaningless of the series recently a friend said me that the 3rd season is really good and i should give it a shot is really changed a lotthanks in advance :,old trekker here should i start watching dis
2683,startrek,its me again as i have stated before i am watching voyager for the first time from beginning to end i am on season 7 episode 15 workforce part 1the doctor as the emergency command hologram is bad ass it is really smart to have that programed for him and only the commanding officers can activate it as much as tuvok and seven of nine are superior assets to the crew the alpha omega super saiyan of the crew is the doctor like when the whole crew had to be in statis pods for like 2 months and only seven and the doctor had to get them through i feel he is the equivalent of data is for enterprise when voyager gets back the federation needs to research how effective holograms are and what they can do for not just sick bay but the whole ship they could get small research vessels with only holograms and go into nebulas or other harmful to humans parts of space and scan to find new information i forsee the ability of having a skeleton crew of human and the rest holograms at least on my ship plus if they get boarded just make 100 klingons or borg or hirogen holograms to fight the intruders its not like they can be shot or hurt thoughts i am aware that there is that beam that gets rid of holograms but you could modulate the shields ahead of time to stop that knowing that would erase your crew also i am aware of the glitches but the doctor is a model 1 holograms not intended for all he does he is beyond his programming and i would thank model 4 or 5 would be more robust and have backup programming if the primary fails you also would surely have to have a programmer or engineer or two to manage all of them plus no food or atmosphere needed the doctor could literally be on the outside of the ship doing repairs as they coast i am just imaging the possibility,voyager the doctor fan boyish post

2697,startrek,watching tng for the first time i like worf its sad that everything he suggests to picard is dismissed example picard: we have problem suggestions worf: we should fire torpedos and show them who is dominant picard: no data: we should hail them picard: yes  i do like how all of worfs suggestions are usually aggressive in nature stemming from his klingon ways and of course picard wouldnt okay it but it makes me sad to see all his ideas are dismissed every time but sometimes they are not aggressive in times arrow when picard and the gang were going on their fun field trip worf was like i am chief security officer it is my duty to tag along and picard was like no you must stay on the ship however every one else who is in the opening credits can come it makes me sad : worf is just taken for granted,does anyone else get sad that all of worfs ideas are always dismissed
2698,startrek,the incidental orchestral score in tos is so striking it got me wondering how it was createdwas each episode shot and edited then shown to an in-house paramount orchestra who set it to musicor did an orchestra record a *lot* of star trek pieces before the series started and they were edited in so well that they seem made for a specific shot,tos production question
2699,startrek,dont get me wrong i loved star trek tos and ng which kept me with ds9 until 68th episode featuring the bajoran lightship made of wood leavers and primitive tools which are manually operated with curved sails as if they are propelled by airthey basically show a sailboat in space which is supposed to be the first spaceship bajorans built and not to mention sisko manages to have artificial gravity aboard this lightship while he manually rotates the leavers to open the sails and use telescope for visual navigation i just dont understand how did they allow such episode,what do you think of the concept of bajoran lightship in star trek ds9
2700,startrek,&gt;caution: i dont know if this was posted before but i could imagine a similar discussion/thought has been posted before please let me know and ill delete my post if this is a repostokay so heres an interesting thought:   * andoria the home of the andorians feels a lot like jupiters moon europa both are moons with a cold climate* vulcan the home of the vulcans feels like mars both are dry-hot planets * qonos the home of the klingons feels like venus if there is one planet that is trying to actually kill you its venus and the klingons well killing is kind of in their blood also the yellow glow of the planet makes me think about the klingon species&amp;#x200b;currently these are the only planets of our solar system i have been able to link to a star trek species but i think this is an interesting thought what do you think,what if star trek species lived on planets of our solar system

2706,startrek,when i first watched ds9 i didnt really understand how the founders could control a whole race of people with a drug ive recently been trying to get off of a medication ive been on for almost 2 years while rewatching ds9 i now realize i can sympathize with them withdrawal is terrible everytime my dosage is reduced it feels like torture its so hard to not take an extra pill to relieve the pain i can now imagine how desperate they are to get more of the drug and that theyll do whatever the founders want for it especially when cut off cold-turkey it must be what im feeling ×10 thought id share my thoughts,ive gained a better understanding of the jemhadars addiction

2708,startrek,so is it just me or has the design of starships across all incarnations straight up jumped the shark i mean i get that discovery is now set 930 years forward and picard is federation adjacent but ive noted some ships of the fleet that are just out thereanybody feeling like trek is trying too hard to be star wars with unconventional ships,star ship designs
2709,startrek,one of the questions that ive often wondered is after first contact and the arrival of the vulcans what do people think happened immediately thereafter canon details of the century between first contact and the start of *enterprise* are relatively sparse-we know that there was something called the post atomic horror somewhat unclear what actually happened and a few prominent figures such as someone called colonel green did some less than ideal stuff and at some point united earth emerged but its never really specified how quickly knowledge of the vulcans spread worldwide and how this happened after all its not even clear what governments still existed in the 2060s post ww3 and to what extent their writ ran and communications were possible for example did the vulcans have to effectively reconnect the chaotic remnants of the world themselves-did they have to do multiple first contacts with multiple governments and if so did they all go peacefully or did vulcan have to disarm some human militaries and where they didnt exist assist in reconstituting some governments on a provisional basis-effectively rebuilding and uniting an entire world from scratch is something of a tall order even for an advanced society like vulcan&amp;#x200b;thoughts,what do we think the vulcans did in the period immediately after first contact
2710,startrek,if someone invented transporter technology there is no way in hell i would use it  weve seen what transporter malfunctions can do  in enterprise everyone was afraid of the transporter  then in kirks era about the only one afraid of the transporter was mccoy  by the next generation era very few people were afraid of using the transporter  why is that  a shuttle may take longer but i think its a better option  let me know what you think in the comments,why arent people more afraid of transporters
2711,startrek,im a 40 yo old school star trek fan that grew up on tng ive watched all manners of trek and loved and hated various aspects of the various tv shows and movies i just cant take the mirror universe in discovery seriously i dont know if it is the fact all the terran leaders are all women if women cant handle sadism and violence in a believable way the writing/story of the episodes or if the actresses in question just dont have the acting chops what do you all think im curious to get opinions from the community from different age ranges,anyone else find the discovery mirror universe is cringey as hell
2712,startrek,just curious as we know captain janeways name changed between the original pilot and kate mulgrew taking over - was the enterprise voyager or deep space 9 ever going to be called something different either in early discussions or script drafts,did the creators of star trek have any other names shortlisted for the enterprise or voyager
2713,startrek,i feel that our literature tv and cinema have always served as a reflection of our culture and i sincerely believe that over the life of the franchise star trek is simply a better reflection let me start by acknowledging the controversial nature of this view within the hardcore geek community but i encourage a spirited debate although i’ll concede that star trek and the next generation tng adhere to the same general naval exploration theme with predictable plots and outcomes both series were written and directed by gene roddenberry i find that the rest of the franchise does much to break this mold **disclaimer - there are naturally several spoilers in the article to follow**starting with deep space nine the first series after roddenberry’s death we see a significant departure from the previous star trek model ds9 largely abandons the naval theme of the previous series and explores the concept of the castle doctrine the military principle of projecting strength from a central base or port at the time of ds9s release most american military experience and doctrine was focused on strength through maneuver rather than castle doctrine it wasn’t until the global war on terror gwot that most americans intuitively understood the principles of fighting from centralized bases the series also dedicates much of the story line to exploring the ideas of asymmetric warfare and insurgency in the years before gwot these concepts were generally unexplored within us media making the show almost prophetic lastly ds9 was also the first star trek series with any meaningful exploration of the subject of religion roddenberry was an avowed atheist and considered religion to be largely superstition i found captain siskos journey from disbelief in his own role in the bajoran religion to his eventual acceptance of the prophets to be extraordinarily insightfulthe next series in the franchise was voyager and it largely expands on the moral dilemmas introduced in ds9 we see that the prime directive is no longer sufficient to provide guidance in a gritty and honest plot line we find the crew of voyager struggling with the morality of doing the wrong thing for the right reason and sacrificing the good of others for the sake of self-preservation i found the early theme of cultural interference to be fascinating the crew of voyager are faced with the eternal decision of helping a developing society or allowing them to suffer through the natural evolution of their circumstances this can be seen in parallel to several modern geo-political situations that we find ourselves in today very insightful and thought provoking situations resulting in no right decision but many wrong ones i found the alliance with the borg late in the series to be a believable and interesting take on the enemy of my enemy is my friend situation and reminiscent of the forced alliance between the american and soviet militaries in wwii i also find captain janeways character to be the most fully articulated star fleet captain of the franchise to datenext came star trek enterprise; easily my favorite series in the star trek universe for the first time we see a meaningful exploration into the limitations that logistics impose into military maneuver and operations most military leaders acknowledge that logistics is often the difference between success and failure on the battlefield but up until this point the writers of star trek had largely ignored the subject i recognize that voyager did explore this subject to a limited extent but enterprise made it a more regular theme we also see an interesting take on anti-imperialism in the human resentment of the vulcans for “holding them back” this can be paralleled to us efforts to influence/shape other nations yet keep them reliant on american support lastly we see captain archer spend his entire life trying to escape his father’s legacy only to discover in the end that he himself is the pivotal historical figure that all humans and the federation in general will later immortalizeplease feel free to add to the discussion i look forward to hearing feedback from both star wars and star trek encampments,star trek is more insightful than star wars

2725,startrek,,what did this guy take from mccoy and what happened to him in the city on the edge of forever
2726,startrek,im starting with tos and decided to jump in with both feet and figure things out not a huge science fiction fan though i dont dislike the genre i was talking with a friend about how i enjoyed star wars potential for complex politics and guiding philosophical motivations in its characters but how most of its shows and films arent really that good -- the universe being better than the writing basically people dont seem to have this issue as much with star trek so ill give it an honest go as this is also part of an endeavor to rebuild my attention span and step away from my smartphone picking up novels again in addition to paying full attention to tos episodes initial thought: enjoyed the pilot with the salt vampire kirks line at the end -- oh i was just thinking about the buffalo -- cemented for me that these episodes want to tackle interesting ideas and dilemmas in the plot,i have begun watching star trek for the first time in my life know nothing about the universe or the characters three episodes in tos enjoy it so far
2727,startrek,,til there were many fights threats and rewrites to harlan ellisons writing treatment of the original series favorite the city on the edge of forever
2728,startrek,with klingon film,how does wharf wrap his sandwiches
2729,startrek,,must say im enjoy discovery
2730,startrek,,is next generation a good place to start
2731,startrek,i’m sure i’m not the first to say all this but i sure as hell didn’t know what sam beckett was doing on a star trek flagship until i actually watched the show my friends i have been more than pleasantly surprised my brain has goose bumps i’m a little worried about starting season 4 and putting this wonderful journey behind me,season 3 enterprise
2732,startrek,so the federation is a completely post-scarcity economy people dont need food or housing or money but the federation still needs resources for a variety of reasons my question is who collects these resources i get the desire to be in starfleet or a chef or a tailor but why a miner i cant imagine anyone would willingly and freely labor away in hot dirty mines doing hard laborious work all the time just curious if its just one of those things or if its ever explained,who mines for the federation
2733,startrek,i never watched ds9 in its entirety ive only watched a few handful of episodes and thats it so im planning on watching ds9 but before i do id like some advice on what episodes i should avoid thanks,what are the ds9 episodes i should avoid
2734,startrek,at the end of season two discovery could have just jumped to the delta quadrant instead of traveling to the future  they could have jumped to earth to warn starfleet about contrrol and then jumped to the delta quadrant  if they had jumped to where voyager was thrown by the caretaker it would take a federation starship of that era almost two hundred years to reach them  their ships were pretty slow back then  they made a lot of progress with warp drive between then and the mid 24th century  so they could have jumped to the delta quadrant and waited for starfleet to wipe out control  this is a way better plan then the insane plan they came up with  so anyway let me know what you think in the comments,why didnt discovery jump to the delta quadrant
2735,startrek,,hi all probably a stupid question but are any of the various uss enterprise iterations visible from the surface while theyre in standard orbit if they are would they have to consider the implications of that with regards to the prime directive when exploring new planets thanks
2736,startrek,hi folks  im totally new to trek and really want to dive in and watch it all i also thought it would be fun to run a podcast so im discussing hosting one with a friend and chatting about each episode as i go  as someone who knows next to nothing about trek and is trying to avoid spoiling anything im just wondering if anyone has a suggestion for a show logo my idea was to call it cadets referencing starfleet cadets and to have the logo/banners visually reference trek cadets in some way from a quick google image search though i couldnt find anything that specifically identifies cadets; in tng it seems as though they share the same red colour as the command folks  so my question is can anyone point me to a colour scheme/insignia from any trek generation although earlier is preferable where someone familiar with trek would see it and say oh thats the cadet colours/symbol from the \\\\ series does something like this exist it wouldnt even need to be a starfleet cadet thats just my initial idea if there is an example of another race or organization with a recognisable symbol for students thats cool too  its 4am here so ill be sleeping as soon as i post this; if there are any questions ill get to them when i wake up  thanks,cadet identification
2737,startrek,in trying to locate it i found this archived thread: and thought i would give this a whirl so here goesas far as i remember it was a shareware game included in the usual 1990s cd-rom of 50+ or 256 shareware/freeware games one could find it was iirc an unofficial star trek dos adventure game that was in first person reminiscent of tos or tas in graphics however the first puzzle of the game was simply to find a way to leave the room and i never did so i would just look around the room and get foiled by the single door and then quit the gamei figured at the time my computer was incompatible for some reason so i could not find ordinary controls or my intuition was terrible or it was an escape room involving a scotty-like cutting of the wall to hack the door mechanism does anyone recall this game was it anything more than a single room and was it gloriously shareware as i suspected but could never confirm,trying to find an unofficial first-person escape room shareware game
2738,startrek,payless,where do klingons buy their shoes
2739,startrek,okay so let me explain what i mean so i’ve been obsessed with tng my whole adult life and like most of you i admire captain picard patrick stewart is magnificent in this role and i’ve always looked at picard as the father i always wanted instead of my back woods gun loving father that being said i finally took the plunge and tried another star trek series namely voyager and holy shit janeway is all over every mission she’s on away missions she’s working with the engineer to find a solution to the problem at hand she comes up with ideas during their group sessions she’s all over the fucking place and i gotta say i’m here for it when going back to watch an episode of tng picard comes off as lazy by comparisons don’t get me wrong i’m not throwing any shade because picard will always be an iconic figure in my life it’s just amazing to me that i never realized how little he actually did when the time came anyways i found it pretty funny to compare the two and i love them both for who they are can’t wait to continue with voyager i don’t know why i let it take me so long on to ds9 next,just started watching voyager and man does janeway make picard look like a slacker
2740,startrek,georgiou is gonei know everyone has differing opinions on the mirror universe and section 31 but there was so much weird behaviour amongst the show in dealing with this mass murderer that didnt make any sense the show is better off without her,finally spoiler
2741,startrek,,only watched the modern films / are the older ones too dated to be viewed now
2742,startrek,she works as a grocery clerk at my local grocery store im 44 years of age and she appears to be about my age she has a body like you wouldnt believe wears skin tight black pants that accentuate her music video dancer bodyin any event whilst ringing me up this evening i summoned the nerve to make smalltalk to which she eagerly fed me information about herself she informed me she was divorced and had childrenmy question is simple if i slay her children is she likely to go into heat like the north american grizzly bear and be more likely to mate with me i wish to mount her greatly and any advice would be appreciated since i havent mounted a human female since 2008thanks,ive made communication with an attractive human female irl
2743,startrek,mandalorian is a huge success and fans love it it has revived the love of starwars for many and rescued the franchise after the disaster that was the sequel trilogydoes that sound familiar the new trek movies in jj era arent as bad as st but they leave a lot to be desired and the new shows are worsewhat mandalorian did was show that old school storytelling characters heart vision and passion can still work most importantly it was done by people who know sw and care about it  its not a show created by hacks like kurtzman and written by a room of writers whose goal is to stuff it full of every modern cliche and tick every pc box again \*exactly\* like how the new st movies were donejj movies/dsc/pic are the equivalent of what jj/kennedy/riann did to starwars - best forgottenmandalorian is starwars it evokes the same feelings we need a trek show with the values of trek - hope exploration optimismhere come the usual complaints about it must be new  you must adapt to modern times and appeal to current agendas  it cant be more of the same utter nonsense trek universe is just as huge and appealing with so many stories left to tell,star trek needs its mandalorian
2744,startrek,i noticed a plot hole concerning the burn since georgiou was sent to the past by the guardian of forever couldnt georgiou warn the federation about the burn before it happens,a plot hole concerning the burn
2745,startrek,the formerly stoic guardian of forever:1: starts acting like a q to the point where up until the reveal i kept waiting for carl to morph into de lancie2:looks like it ate the time tunnel although the drifting co2 fog machine would have been way too 60s it would have been nice the way the old guardian showed images of the paston the other hand overall the upgraded design does look hella cool dunnit,what do you think of that fact that in only 1000 years
2746,startrek,okay i’ve been watching and rewatching a lot of star trek lately and i’ve had not necessarily changes of my favourites but updates i will probably have notes beside a couple of these because i need to happy vent is that a thing you get what i mean also i’m adding lower decks because i have since watched it and discovery because it’s gotten so much better seeing as i didn’t add them last time tos: spock i’m not adding aos because they’re movies and also because spock would still be my favourite tng: data he’s awesome and i love him that’s all there is too itds9: odo and bashir they’re joint because i adore them both plus it’s sooo hard to choose just one fave from ds9 voyager: shamefully i still haven’t watched voyager yet so i don’t know it’ll probably be the doctor but i don’t know yet enterprise: phlox he’s so weird and odd and i love it discovery: saru this is gonna be a long one so buckle in i really didn’t know how i felt about any of the character until hallways through season 2 when i realised out of the blue that saru had really grown on me i then realised he was my favourite and from there he just became an absolutely amazing character also props to him because i was beginning to think i’d never have a captain as a favourite character so not only is saru the first non-human captain but he’s also the first captain in all of star trek to be a favourite character of mine lower decks: rutherford personally i wish they’d focus more on his character because he really is an awesome dude can’t wait for season 2,favourite character from each series updated list and will contain spoilers
2747,startrek,,star trek: the next generation: season 3 is 36% off
2748,startrek,,i am planning to collect some sociology information about us star trek fans because i think that would be interesting to do im then going to share info back with the community as im preparing the questionnaire what sorts of questions would you want to know about who star trek fans are

2751,startrek,i told him to watch ds9 then and he said he has no interest in anymore sci-fi schlock for the foreseeable future and i truly pity the man,my brother hates the mandalorian
2752,startrek,i was like wow this episode has its own disc in the box set this is because it has the tribbles episodes from tas and ds9 on but i found it funny since i was going in totally blind and unaware of the tribbles i know trouble with tribbles has been posted about before buuuutall i can say is whoever was on set dropping tribbles on kirk from the grain container must have been having a whale of a time i was dying scotty might steal the show in this episode though love his scenestos is so so good season 2 has been a real winner so far,just watched the trouble with tribbles

2766,startrek,for the original series movies:1 - trippiest  2 - best action  3 - prettiest  4 - most fun  5 - best character scenes  6 - best story  what are yours,film superlatives
2767,startrek,i’m rewatching the search for spock today and something really bothered me  in sarek’s first scene with kirk sarek really pushes kirk to take spock’s body to vulcan he says things like “you denied his future” “all vulcans do this” etc he culminates this speech by rallying kirk to genesis imploring him to find any way to do it  this is not how i remember the scene at all in my memory kirk was desperate for anything that could bring back spock sarek was much more incredulous about kirk’s chances to save spock even commenting on the antiquity and rarity of the whole katra thing the scene i recall was kirk pulling information from sarek and denying all logic to save spock am i remembering this completely wrong or is there an alternate version of the film somewhere that i’ve seen nothing else seems to be different so far so this is bugging me,mandela effect on st:iii or just poor memory
2768,startrek,everybody keeps saying its among the best of the star trek series but ive watched a season and a half before realizing that for so long i had started work every morning lamenting the fact that id be spending my free time watching this show i read online that its best to skip ahead to the part of the show where &gt;sisko gets command of the defiant&lt; im still bored as all hell how is this among the best of the star trek series i liked *enterprise* more than this the whole series so far has felt like a childrens show even during the more boring parts of the other series i still enjoyed the characters enough to stick with them i dont find any of the characters in ds9 to be interesting in the leasti feel like ds9 has also almost ruined the bajoran-cardassian conflict which i actually found interesting in tng if it really is among the best then surely someone can point out the revolutionary turning point in ds9 after which the show becomes *so* good that it makes the average enjoyability of the whole series comparable to that of tos and tng,when does deep space nine finally get to be good
2769,startrek,hi all sorry about this    ive been tasked with taking over someones secret santa as the person who was meant to be buying for them has let us all down    the only hint they left was original star trek    now due to the last minute nature and the covid restrictions were in i have to rely on amazon uk - does anyone have any ideas what would be a nice gift £15-30 can be more if need be with these narrow restrictions   thanks again,late secret santa request

2772,startrek,,kurtzman trek is creating a toxic divide amongst fans
2773,startrek,spoilers for discoveryin the latest episode georgiou is sent to an unspecified time when the mirror and prime universes were not that far apart given narrative in the rest of discovery indicates there hasnt been a crossing in over 500 years speaking from the 31st century and given that the majority of documented crossings span the 22nd century enterprise the 23rd century tos and dis and the 24th century tng ds9 then it seems plausible that this 200 year period is the target setting for the new section 31 show starring georgiouwhat is your preferred time and eventpersonally i think the new show should effectively act as the sadly never made season 5 of enterprise which as the build up set in season 4 makes clear was supposed to chart the opening of the earth-romulan war afterall war settings are generally the best use of a spy agency in a dramatic setting it also gives the show the chance to go into detail about the politics and machinations behind the founding of the federation which happened as a direct result of the war,preferred setting for the new section 31 show

2779,startrek,i’m starting ds9 again for the umpteenth time and it just hit me: sisko *knew* this was going to be an especially dangerous mission i know starships typically have family on board but when they’re heading into that type of battle with the foreknowledge that there’s a high percentage chance they won’t make it they could easily hop by a star base and drop off non essential passengers five minutes: head there beam them off go fight why didn’t he do it i kinda blame him now for the whole thing,if sisko knew he was going into a dangerous battle with the borg at 359 why the hell are his wife and kid on board

2782,startrek,so i absolutely loved *terra firma pt 2* most everything about it was fantastic other than no lorca i only had one major gripe the opening theme was just lazy *enterprise* spoiled us on creative mirror universe openingliterally all they did was change the colors and flip the animations upside down mirrors dont turn things upside down they **mirror** them and we still had models of things that werent in the mirror universe like the new commbadges and bookers ship the blue color was fantastic and i know they probably didnt think the budget increase was worth it for special animations for one opening of one episode i just feel like they shouldve either done more or done nothing at all,the opening to the most recent episode was disappointing
2783,startrek,,if operation warp speed continues to slow down should we start calling it operation one quarter impulse power
2784,startrek,guysall this reverence for mirror georgiou all of a sudden in this ep is really a bit grating for me this is literally a genocidal woman who also ate the flesh of sentient beings the signficant change georgiou also went through in this episode it just seems like a major leap and not gradual am i the only one uncomfortable with how everyone just conveniently forgot she was space hitler and guilty of multiple horrendous crimes i just dont understand it,i dont mind disco but this last ep and georgiou

2791,startrek,they comitted genocide i believe that goes against everything trek stands for other epusodes might be stupid or goofy but not outrageous like this,dear doctor is the worst episode in all of trek
2792,startrek,ive been rewatching discovery  just for the hell of it  and i watched an episode in season two where they find a planet fifty thousand light years away with humans who were brought there hundreds of years ago by what they called the red angel  which just turned out to be a time traveler  and i noticed how easily primitive people are fooled by advanced technology  they saw them beam up and thought they were gods  it just shows how easy it is to fool primitive people who havent seen technology  we dont have transporter tech but a lot of people if they saw someone disappear into thin air they wouldnt just assume they were a god  if we saw a hundred foot jesus in the sky we wouldnt just assume that its really a deity  holograms have been in science fiction for decades and the government has secretly been developing that tech  but primitive people cant conceive of technology that can make someone disappear or project a hundred foot jesus into the sky  so they are really easy to fool  it makes me wonder how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating the major religions  because that is what happened in that episode  they saw a time traveler with advanced tech and thought it was an angel  you can fool primitive people with parlor tricks like that  but you cant fool a technological civilization  even a primitive one  so how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating religion  just something to think about  honestly im surprised that in star trek the federation doesnt deal with more prime directive violations like that  someone could land on a primitive planet and pose as a god  im surprised its not a common occurrence  anyway let me know what you think in the comments,fooling primitive people with technology

2801,startrek,with this post i just want to ask how other fans react to my unpopular opinions ill try to keep it as spoilerfree as i can except for lower decks picard episode 3 onwards short treks episode 6 onwards and voyager episode 26 onwards because i havent seen them yet and i cant spoil anything what i havent seen right 😂also it could be that ive more i just dont know if my opinion is controversal and dont name every trek-specific controversal opinion because i have too much im easy to impressanyway lets start:**the original series**i think its definetly controversal to say that i really like the alternative factor in my opinion its a great story implementing an entire universe called the anti-matter universe and we see some interesting dynamics between the trekverse  and this universe what i really likealso most people think turnabout intruder is the worst tos episode why in my opinion its the best of season 3 and also one of the best tos episodes it has a great and unique idea that the captain is no longer the captain because he was possessed  ok i dont know the word in english because im not english but hopefully you understand what i mean and this allows also for a interesting dynamic between kirk the ghost of him and kirk the woman in the body of kirkand lastly city on the edge of forever is the worst episode ever joke**the animated series**idk if its that controversal but when i go by the imdb score theres definetly a difference so i name the 2 episodes but i wouldnt call them something special i kinda enjoy bem and the magicks of megas-tu but i cant tell why except for yesteryear more tribbles more troubles the series finale and the named episodes is this series awful so i have nothing more to say**movies 1-6**the only realy controversal opinion is that i think wrath of khan is just alright because khan is annoying and feels like no threat at all i think its annoying that kirk being an admiral and kirks son is also annoying like project genesis,unpopular opinions - how would other fans react to mine part 1: tos tas and the movies 1-6

2804,startrek,i want my friend to have an exciting experience with the world-building and references i suggested the mudd episodes city on the edge of forever and the unifications i feel like there was another one in particular i thought of but cant remember   im also interested in revisiting episodes the kelvin timeline and tos movies are on my to watch list and i just barely got around to starting enterprise so suggestions for me would be awesome too,what trek episodes would you suggest for a casual fan to watch before starting discovery
2805,startrek,the one where crusher falls in love with a ghostorthe one where data has multiple egyptian-like personalitiesclearly i think both are terrible and are probably at the bottom of the list of tng episodes but i am wondering what others think,which of these two tng episodes is worse
2806,startrek,,why is it that laforge wears sunglasses in st: first contact when he doesnt even wear his visor anymore
2807,startrek,aside from a couple of comments first post in r/startrek just sharing something here because its wholesome me and my sister grew up together watching the very occasional episode i was 8 and she was 6 when tng first aired in our country aided by our mum who was secretly a big ol nerd and would insist that we kept trek on if we ran across it while channel hopping i think my first memory of the show is the bit in the naked now when data is putting the chips back in the board super fasti started really paying attention in high school around ds9s later seasons and for some reason my sis ended up watching a lot more tng than i did as we grew into adults i mainly stuck to many of my nerdy pursuits going on a more tech-fuelled life trajectory and she broadened her horizons with travel languages and teaching but it always stayed as a running joke that any time she was stuck shed think what would captain picard do or what would snoop dogg do  but thats another storywere super tight - best friends and in lockdown finally i got her to give ds9 a try this is after years of me going seriously its serialised its complex nobodys purely good or evil youll love it worf is in it and her going i believe you im sure its great but i love tng so much its what i grew up with id feel like i was cheating on tng if i got into ds9well one of the stations she watches started airing the whole run and shes tried it and she loves it in her words i think i might be able to be er polytrekerous shes already latched onto father of the year benjamin sisko and spotted how if something bads gonna happen to someone its gonna happen to miles edward obrien her favourite characters are odo and quark no change from the few episodes she saw as a little kid then and as of the writing of this post shes up to the past tense two partertheres no point to this post really other than to give you all an awww so i hope it did,my baby sis
2808,startrek,,star trek discovery notes and why the show is bad
2809,startrek,no seriously next time you watch ds9 keep an eye on quarks mouth all the ferengi do this open-mouth thing but armin is probably the best at itprobably to show off the pointy teeth prosthetics and to make them look a bit dim ferengi almost always have their mouths open the few times his mouth is closed its usually in consternation the wide open but pointy smile fits so well with ferengi attitude happy to please--but theyre always ready to bite at least your wallet and try talking with your lips pressed over your gums like that--its weird im sure they must have practiced it a lot  it gives them a genuinely alien demeanor in a way thats not over the top i really like it a lot also shoutouts to sarus supermodel walk which is great too i imagine aliens would have all sorts of mild mannerism quirks like that and little things we do would stand out as odd to them,quarks mouth is an example of unexpectedly great in-depth acting
2810,startrek,deleted,holy craaaaaaap have you all seen the documentary about ds9 what we left behind
2811,startrek,watching ds9 so yeah worf broke a kids neck playing soccer when he was a child so is manslaughter not a thing in star trek  also how come you can damn near take over the station and only get 6 months in a holding cell and a finger wag from odo remember when garak tried to hot wire the defiant and wipe out the founders from orbit after fighting worf for control of the console  yup you guessed it 6 months in a holding cell compliments of odo  it seems like you can do almost anything on ds9 and get away with it  oh yeah worf stabbed his brother in the chest with a knife and tried to deliberately kill him oh sure it was because of some klingon nonsense but worf knew better he is in starfleet and still no consequences its almost like the future is filled with lofty speeches but no justice i dont know  maybe im just over thinking it,star trek justice system especially ds9

2817,startrek,hi folks with permission from the mods i am posting a link to a pdf version of roddenberrys story bible for tos its basically a guide he made for writers of the original series to follow while scripting the show im sending the link that bypasses the ads and stuff enjoy and thanks to the modsps - i am a screenwriter but not for this show i typically post in a different sub but i thought you all would want to read this,gene roddenberrys tos writers guide from april 1967
2818,startrek,so im streaming  st:tng s3 ep23 picard said he attended sareks sons wedding was this a reference to spock or the other son from the 5th movie that no one wants to think about or were there other offspring that somehow werent mentioned like michael from discovery im confused,something picard said re: sarek
2819,startrek,i made a post in october about how i was beginning tos again after a decade since i first watched 2/3rds of it last night i completed the series and i am really stunned by the experience having never finished the series as a kid there was so much i hadnt seen before and so much i hadnt remembered theres a lot the criticize but the show is easily one of the best ive ever seen--theres a magic to it that gives it so much staying power heres some quick and largely unoriginal thoughts:* i watched it in production order and i feel it was definitely the right decision it created a sense of continuity in watching the show develop in a linear way theres a degree of character development that comes from the actors growing into their characters* expanding on that  i swapped the order of the last 2 episodes so that it ended with all our yesterdays another good decision imo--its a stunning episode and as kirk-spock-mccoy story it makes for a fitting ending* kirk spock and mccoy are the heart of the show and their relationship is of its consistent strengths its less of an ensemble show than i remember ive seen it mentioned before but it wasnt something i noticed when i was younger* spock is the best character kirk is a great captain and isnt the womanizing swashbuckler hes portrayed as in pop culture and in the kelvin films* season 3 isnt that bad the budget cuts are obvious and you can tell that they ran out of money at the end there but overall i loved most of it when its at its best it has some of the series highest moments its uneven and suffers more from being underdeveloped and underfunded than being outright bad not to say it doesnt suck donkey balls sometimes i was genuinely surprised overall* favorite episode: the enterprise incident * other favorites in no order: mirror mirror a piece of the action the menagerie all our yesterdays journey to babel metamorphasis arena where no man has gone before dagger of the mind i mudd a private little war the savage curtain the tholian web * least favorites again no order: the alternative factor catspaw the apple the gamesters of triskellion miri tomorrow is yesterday the paradise syndrome let that be your last battlefield whom gods destroy the mark of gideon turnabout intruder the way to eden that which survives the omega gloryoverall this was a truly amazing experience and im so excited to inevitably rewatch it a thousand more times im beginning tas now which i also saw about half of about a decade ago so itll be like watching it for the first time ive heard good things about star trek continues so i might have to give it a watch too as well as throw in some new voyages/phase ii because it was really important to me as a kid then ill be onto the movies which ive seen countless times and then onto tng which ive seen maybe 25 episodes of and then the other 6 😳 shows--so ive got a lot ahead of me lmao id say this has been a great decision,finished my first full watch of tos
2820,startrek,ok i need to know this: am i actually the only one who would love to watch a serie about the temporal wars and if the name is not correct i’m sorry but i’m not a native english speakeri think it should be definitely an interesting concept what do you think,time wars
2821,startrek,i can name many bad things that can happen because of following the prime directive  \- allowing a civilisation to die out  \- standing by and doing nothing to stop genocide  \- allowing countless people to suffer preventable disease and death  \- robbing people of the opportunities that joining the galactic society would bring   \- ect ect  and for what good to stop federation members to act like gods i think people with that intend would not follow the prime directive when given the opportunity and if someone did do exactly that then they would be stopped by the greater federation  so what good does the prime directive bring,is the prime directive evil
2822,startrek,by the time we enter into canon enterprise show linearly a lot is already worked out awareness of more species than vulcans development of higher warp and transport tech etc id love to see how things went right after the bozeman contact and i think it could be a while series surely the early early days were met with a lot of good stories i know we wouldnt have a starship but id like the story of how we got there and you can have other types of heroes too,what do you think about a show from the time of cochrane to archer

2830,startrek,linkwhen i saw the ncia-93-type for the first time i instantly fell in love with it discovery has been my favorite star trek series so far despite its rocky start so i felt i needed to give one of my favorite ships from it some love,fan art uss aphenphosmphobia ready for orders
2831,startrek,im 100% supportive of more diversity in star trek in all forms and think it just makes the show better i am somewhat concerned though that this is just becoming a boxchecking exercise for the writers in particular with adira theyve introduce the character had the character say im non-binary and then seemed to have moved on so far can anyone who identifies as trans/non-binary provide some insight into whether they feel dsc s3 has/is trying to capture the experience and/or deal with it in a productive way i personally am a straight white caucasian american male and really have zero clue what its like to be trans/non-binary or indeed if those are different things i was hoping for plots subtext convos that illustrate the subtleties of the experience/issue the way st has historically done with many not all social issues in a positive way,non-binary characters/thoughts
2832,startrek,there is a scene in s3e2 *far from home* where an ensign/hazmat officer is cleaning up bodily remains in the spore cube he says his name is gene and tig notaros character dismisses him and says shes already forgotten his name everyone seems to think naming him gene was a reference to gene roddenberry but i cant imagine that is true there is no way theyd reference him by concocting a scene where we see him basically doing some demeaning janitorial work and then being disrespected by a superior officer i am pretty sure they just named him gene and werent even thinking of roddenberry chances are it was a nod to the plight of low ranking officers established in *lower decks* any thoughts,possibly stupid question: is the ensign in s3e2 named after gene roddenberry

2835,startrek,yupjust wanted to report in: i am one of them now by the end of the season 3 they got mei really like how the characters evolve over the course of the series i like how the villains are written i like the implementation of early federation there are many small well thought out details all over the place why o why it takes so long to developfor the lack of more seasons i blame the cursed song,so it finally happened i started to like enterprise
2836,startrek, watching this episode for the first time just made me question how dumb worf and jadzia really are worf has always been kind of the punching bag in tng as the dumb brute who always had his ideas shot down but in ds9 he was suppose to be taken more seriously but in change of heart there was nothing more stupid than what had happenedtheyre on their way to rendezvous with a cardassian spy walking 20kms through dense jungle behind enemy linesjadzia gets shot about 7kms into the journey by some jemhadar and is steadily bleeding from her wound instead of telling her to turn around and go back to the runabout to get rest and/or treat herself with worf venturing out to the rendezvous point on his own he drags her with him for the next 13km trip what was his plan here have her go with him to get the spy and then walk another 20kms back to the runabout if the first 13km didnt kill her the second 20kms definitely will this is on top of both of them constantly having to delay and rest to tend to her wound just the worst strategy everi know this episode is suppose to demonstrate how deep their love is but all it demonstrated to me is how bad worf is at tactics and strategy  at the end of the episode sisko tells worf he will probably never get his own command even though he does command the defiant multiple times after this event i completely agree that he should never be in charge of people,what was worfs plan in s6e16 change of heart

2843,startrek,cbs all access has 1 tos film 3 tng films and 0 kelvin films now that cbs &amp; viacom have merged they own the rights to all the films it should be no problem putting them on cbs all access however  i know the films might be contracted out to other streaming services so does anyone know when those contracts end and therefore when these films will be available for cbs all access really any information is appreciated,when will the kelvin star trek films come to cbs all access/paramount plus

2845,startrek,deleted,why is mirror universe so sexy
2846,startrek,watching season 3 for the first time and as im pushing through the episodes the utter lack of trust between characters is really disturbing one of the things that has always separated star trek to me as a tng fanboy was the intrinsic trust that shared ideals and hard work could garner in a team with the whole crew of the discovery sharing the same star fleet ideals and all of them busting their asses to be the best id expect trust to be a backdrop of the series but like many dramas today distrust is used to propel the story along and create obstacles for characters to overcome when a true starfleet crew would have never encountered that  to put it simply the discovery crew is like a crew full of barkleys and wesley crushers,discovery gripe
2847,startrek,,its pretty pathetic that people are paying for cbs all access just to see star trek and their servers are still stuttering and unreliable
2848,startrek,im rewatching the episode crisis point for the 3rd or 4th time and i just noticed a weed joke:**billups**: damnit we dont have much time rerouting the vent system would take a whole team**rutherford**: if we bypass the indicontrols and suppress the sativents it should function as a**both**: rudimentary plasma filteredit: for the unindoctrinated indica and sativa are the two different types of weed,lower decks: weed humor

2857,startrek,i recently got a cbs all access subscription and watched picard and lower decks i wasnt a big fan of picard i didnt like the heavily serialized story with its emphasis on secrets mysteries and conspiracies nor do i like mystery box stories i did like lower decks though its a more traditional star trek series with episodic stories based on exploration and with fun characters should i expect to like discovery or no,if i didnt like the heavily serialized storytelling of picard will i like discovery

2863,startrek,its just so so so good ive seen the entire series twice already but its honestly incredible how well it holds up and remains relevant ~25 years later especially in a covid19 world the socio-politial commentary is something ds9 never shied away from with the way things are going the horror of having sanctuary cities doesnt seem too far off especially with people having to become more reliant on government services because they lost their jobs during covid and of course the fact that sisko has to become gabriel bell is the perfect sci-fi star trek twist to it i dont have any friends that love and obsess about star trek the way i do and i know tons of people feel the same way about this two parter and ds9 in general over here in /r/startrek peace and love to everyone,rewatching ds9s past tense two parter and
2864,startrek,i have an idea in how to connect the space station of episode 03 with the mobile federation hq- the nivar trust now starfleet or at last discovery to give them one of their sb-19 gates- let the discovery jump back to this station with her spore drive and deliver this gate- the other side is at the mobile hq so they also receive one sb-19 gate - et voila of course they first send only robot ships to starting fixing the station and do space wreaks cleanup to make it save for ships- sb-19 travel-route doneor other solution- let discovery repair the needed subspace relays to get in contact with the station- if they succeed in making contact they are not home yet- if communications and data link is established they could try something out- someone invent some sort of 3d printer with an data link trough this communication line- yes some sort of remote controlled 3d printer - discovery could deliver this platform as well and all they need to run it up- they teleport the robot drones trough this solution for humans this is still to risky- they fix the station and do the cleanup until the mobile hq can visit it in realsure if they could right away teleport humans trough this then they also could directly get the trans warp device out of the bin or even build an bigger one to teleport entire ships no spore drive is needed so since it is to early for this invention we need this ancient prototype here,idea for an discovery scene possible in season 4
2865,startrek,the cold open for the ds9 episode where jake and nog try to get benjamin the baseball card it’s ben having the ops crew over for dinner and trying to talk about anything but the impending war and they can’t cause nothing else is happening it really hit me hard today because same,ds9 5:25’s cold open hit different this watch through

2903,startrek,so i made this as an ornament idea and i liked how it turned out,my holiday ornament
2904,startrek,considering they used something created by harlan ellison they could have at least given him a created by credit its not in the opening credits nor is it in the closing i watched both twice to double checkpretty disgusting did they just wait for him to die so they could loot his corpsegiven the fact they give credit for using a few bars of alexander courages music the fact they used a massive plot element from a writer means they couldnt acknowledge himedit - i guess the people downvoting think its okay to just lift ideas and not give proper credit for them - thats called stealing,there is no credit given to the original writer who created the idea used in todays episode *spoilers*

2908,startrek,staying up until midnight pst for the new discovery to go on cbs all access who else does this,discovery
2909,startrek,ive recently re-watched tng and i have to say im impressed at how well the computers there have aged they certainly werent perfect but for the most part they remain believable im currently watching ds9 and ive realized that their computers havent aged as well and the reason is that better technology was available for the set buildersds9 shows more of the screens to the audience than tng did we see a lot more video and animations on the ds9 computers than we did on the tng ones the result is that ds9 computers look have a 1990s look to them but somehow tng doesnt this makes me wonder how the technology in shows like discovery will look 30 years from nowi do not believe tos aged as well as tng in this respect but considering how old that show is i think it did remarkably well my favorite example has to be the spock-o-scope from a set design standpoint it was a box with a blue light in it but to the audience it can display anything it needs to a computer screen cant look dated if its never actually shown to the audience,star trek computers and how dated they look now
2910,startrek,i dont watch the next time on so if that addresses any of this please dont spoil it for mewhile watching the last episode of discovery i realized we dont know how long a kelpien lives up until discovery time traveled kelpiens were killed before living to an old age sure 31st century starfleet knows the lifespan of a kelpien a current federation member but not discovery not even georgiou knows &gt;well knew&lt;so why is this relevant well we know that one seemingly young kelpien was on a ship at the center of the burn 125 years ago if it were a vulcan the possibility that that individual is still alive is more then plausible and this kelpien was a doctor the ship is still working or at least transmitting after 125 years suggesting something is maintaining itso will we see this kelpien woman latter in the series again no spoilers including next time on beyond ep 10 please,it occurs to me we dont know how long kelpiens live
2911,startrek,i only remember seeing this happen once in voyager the doctor when he was the ech he fired a photon torpedo and hit it with the phasers the shock wave disabled a few enemy shipsis it a targeting delay or something like that the sensors can tell when torpedos were fired the targeting computer should be able to lock on to them quickly im also surprised there were no counter measures besides sheilds used,in battle why doesnt star fleet target the opponents torpedos with the phasers
2912,startrek,ive been following this link   to watch in chronological order and it has just disappeared does anyone have a copy or know of something similar it included discovery and short treks i cant find the post i found it from ive checked the sidebar post but theyre not quite the same thanks for any help,help with deleted link
2913,startrek,i recently rewatched all of tng and was surprised by how much continuity there actually is here -- both in character development and in plotthere are season-long arcs that establish bad guys long stretches of episodes where the writers are fleshing out a few key characters its a way better experience than just picking random favorite episodes youll find all-new appreciation for the early seasons season 2 is especially excellent and its just such a cool experience to see the show completely switching gears as they rotate through different show runners,if youve never binge-watched tng

2915,startrek,*have you ever considered minsk* i just love that worf line so much everyone is celebrating at vics at the end of the dominion war and the series and obrien mentions he hasnt picked a place to live back home*minsk* worf repeats without even considering everyone else suggestions its just such a fun little line showing worfs affection for the place where he grew upworf was always an complicated character to like for me but that little bit gave him some points,minsk
2916,startrek,at least threshold is fun for a laugh this shit is so bad i am watching it right now and nothing about it makes any logical sense,the fight is the worst voyager episode
2917,startrek,so i was thinking quark and anya would get along well and also odo and monk does anyone have any other pairs of ttek and non-trek characters they think would get along,characters from non-trek shows trek characters would get along with
2918,startrek,just curious but does it bother anyone that there was no video of away missions in the very advanced 24th century sure we had some once from some mission geordi was on years ago but for the most part non-existent even today operatives have cameras stuff is shared real-time in some cases etc yeah yeah interference from the planet in some cases but it wasnt even like it was a real option and yes the stories would have had to be told differently but it just seems like a no-brainer,away mission video
2919,startrek,deleted,oc i am a 3d and vfx artist this is my love song to the starship enterprise i hope it makes you feel the way i feel when i think about her
2920,startrek,having watched tng and enterprise when i was younger rewatched them years later and now with discovery and picard i decided to give a go to other parts of trek starting with ds9 and so far i have found the show lacking something the ship designs are kinda weird and honestly 8 episodes in and the show itself is kinda boring seems like a common trend that first seasons of trek are always somewhat problematic but even that put aside we then get to jadzia daxeveryone talks about how enterprise overly sexualizes tpol but what the hell is happening in ds9 and dax every episode so far has a throwaway line of how gorgeous and alluring jadzia is if its not dr bashir its quark and of course everyone assumes sisko must have had relations with her given their pastits off putting and creepy its not something i have seen mentioned and im worried it gets worse so does it get worse,ds9 and the jadzia dax problem
2921,startrek,i just finished rewatching ds9 not only my favorite piece of trek ever but one of the best shows period for me and was looking for other sci-fihaving exausted the whole of trek i was thinking of trying babylon 5 i have heard that the producers of said show accused the execs of paramount of ripping out their idea for a space station show and gluing star trek on the name and ive also seen multiple statements throught the years saying that the two shows would steal a lot from one another im conflicted because many years ago i tried to get into it and after 2 or 3 episodes it didnt really stick but the same thing happened with ds and whe i tried again later i loved itso my question is is babylon 5 similar to ds9 is it even on the same scale quality wise,is babylon 5 really similar to ds9
2922,startrek,hope this is an ok question to ask here recently started watching tng during lockdown which lead to watching everything else my fiancé wants to get me a star trek gift do you have a suggestion for a enterprise d model/toy that’s bigger for around $150,new fan question about models and such

2926,startrek,i am excited and honored to introduce:my 2020 definitive ranking of every* star trek series** from worst to bestbefore i begin you may be asking why well as it turns out eliminating almost all social or external activity for about 9 months gives you an incredible amount of time to watch*** literally every episode of star trek plus most of them were added to netflix this year so that made it pretty easy to just hit playnow lets get to the list:ranked from worst to best based on modern watchability:8enterprise 2001-20057the original series 1966-19696voyager 1995-20015discovery 2017 - present4the next generation 1987-19943picard 2020 - present2lower decks 2020 - present1deep space 9 1993-1999i can hear you say how dare you rank x series at y place i will discuss each series in detail below so you can review my reasoning also this is based on my opinion and you can feel free to disagree in the commentsyou may also wonder if my opinions were biased by the order in which i watched the series to which i say sure thats entirely possible heres the order i watched them starting in february and ending today: tng - ds9 - voyager - picard - lower decks - tos discovery was watched concurrently with several series as it was releasedseries comments:deep space 9: ds9 might be the most non-standard star trek that was ever released and it quickly became my favorite not only were the characters complex and well developed the scripts were unique the storylines were a nice combination of episodic and serialized and its themes continue to hold up it was heartbreaking funny exciting thought-provoking and world-building it was just the best combination of everything youd want from star trek if you were to go watch one series this is the one i recommend lower decks: the most-recently debuted and only the second animated series lower decks might seem like an underdog for the top rankings but for someone whose media consumption has been steeped in star trek i was the exact target audience literally every line of the script is dripping with reference and nostalgia combined with some universally appreciable comedy this isnt going to be for everyone but it has been one that i have thoroughly appreciatedpicard: this is where the list starts to get tough and i could absolutely see picard tng and discovery moving around in my ranking as more episodes are released picard has only one season so far but that season was one of the most well-produced serialized seasons ive seen it had a nice balance of nostalgia and new storylines it continued the trend towards darker and more dramatic sets and i hope future seasons continue the trendthe next generation: ill admit this is the series that had the most nostalgia for me though i was too young to have watched it while it aired tng undoubtedly kicked off the second era of star trek which was what i grew up on to be honest i had this ranked higher before i watched tos i once read a criticism of tng that so many of its scripts were just re-skinned tos scripts and unfortunately that was pretty true especially for the first 15 seasons and for a large number of exploration-related episodes that being said tngs uniqueness were in the episodes that were similar to deep space 9 tngs enterprise was a ship of diplomacy as opposed to exploration and contained families and more complex relationships and that led to a much more well-developed feel for the seriesdiscovery: tng and discovery are probably the closest between any two series on this list they are both good for different reasons discovery is the first star trek series to make a full transition from an episodic to a serialized format and while its first season may have had some isolated storylines most of the show follows a single thread the characters are great and the story is pretty good though the visuals definitely draw from the kelvin timeline star trek films read: lens flares which is not necessarily a bad thing the 3rd season is currently airing and it is certainly the best so far though it also portrays a very different world that is characterized by its scarcity ultimately i think its very possible that the series will rise above tng but i think only time will tellvoyager: this show suffered from living in the shadow of tng unfortunately i think the transition from the plentiful federation of tng to the stark shortage of resources in voyager just felt too different the series was good and some of its characters stand out as star trek all-stars and janeway is probably the most under-rated captain its stories werent particularly unique for the most part and most of the show suffered from the largest downside of tng rehashing old themesthe original series: for some this will be the most controversial part of my list i can hear it already it was good for its time heres the problem: this isnt the 1960s anymore in one sentence it was sexist campy tired on-the-nose groundbreaking and did i mention sexist listen i watched every* star trek series thats ever been made and i made this list based on which series i think people should watch today not by time-traveling back to when the show first aired it doesnt hold up as well as many wish it did and most of the best tos wasnt actually in the 3 seasons that aired but in the films which i am not including in my rankings** enterprise: most of the people that say they liked this series are confusing it because of its name with tos coming out of tng ds9 and voyager it was just disappointing theres a lot that went wrong here but i think the influence of 9/11 on american culture and television stands out it took a 180 degree turn on portraying a future without prejudice in fact most of the main characters are prejudiced in one form or another and its theme song sucked yes im going to lay at least some of the blame on the theme just listen to it its just bad so there you go 757 episodes of star trek later i hope you enjoyed the fruits of my labors over the past 9 months of quarantine instead of learning mandarin picking up the guitar or reading more books i watched all of star trek and with that burden of knowledge i bestow up on you my 2020 definitive ranking of every* star trek series** from worst to best*excluding star trek: the animated series feel free to make a case for why i should have watched it below but i have yet to hear one**films and movies are a subject for another list i think the procuction budgets format and timing constraints make films significantly different from content developed for a tv series also they werent on netflix***its important to know that a significant number of episodes were consumed in an almost podcast-like format while i went on solitary walks to get out of the house during quarantine this turned out not to have been as much of a hindrance especially for the older series considering the amount of reused sets and visuals,a quarantine obsession becomes the 2020 definitive star trek series ranking
2927,startrek,so i’m rewatching tng one episode is like we need to intercept them asap set course warp 5 why aren’t they going warp 9come to think of it why would they even travel below warp 9,why don’t they always travel at warp 8 or 9
2928,startrek, its been a long road getting from there to hereseriously this show is severely underrated i enjoy the sense that they are real pioneers exploring the true unknowni am halfway through the first season and really enjoying it looking forward to the rest of the series and yes i know about the finale,lifelong trekkie watching ent for the very first time and i have to say
2929,startrek,when it became clear that this pandemic was going to last a long time i ordered a face mask from an etsy seller it was designed to look like a tng uniform--mostly blue black border on the top comm badge insignia over the left side of my jaw and two rank pips over the right side ive worn it since may i figure if i have to wear a mask i may as well have fun with itin that time nobody has said anything about it except my wife until yesterdayi was walking through the bread aisle at the grocery store a man about my age and his daughter age 11 i would guess were approaching opposite me suddenly he grinned and said hey check out this guys mask his daughter smiled and kind of gasped i could tell they were both fans of the showthen he quizzed her: whats his ranklieutenant she guessedright on i answered and we went our separate waysthat simple but pleasant interaction gave me a big boost for the rest of the evening i just wanted to share,someone finally acknowledged my tng uniform face mask
2930,startrek,i am shocked how much i love this show its ahead of tos and voyager for me im at the beginning of season 2 but i cant get over how great it is it has its faults but damn its good and yesi have learned to love the theme song ha,i really really like enterprise
2931,startrek,im watching star trek 3 the search for spock and i came to realize that they could just flip the ship 90 degrees and get out of space dock more quickly because the ship would be narrower along the x axis   theres no inherent reason why the top of the ship needs to be parallel to the galactic plane  the people inside wouldnt know the difference,wouldntbit make sense to flip federation ships 90% so theyre narrower relative to the galactic plane
2932,startrek,,would you choose jonathan frakes or brent spiner for a birthday cameo
2933,startrek,its not expressly referred to as a christmas episode but is literally the same plot as many hallmark christmas movies ive seen with a few sci fi twists of coursealso a great episode highly recommend adding to your christmas movie/tv watch list this seasonwhat else we got in the star trek universe for christmas episodesmerry christmas,star trek voyager - 11:59 a christmas episode
2934,startrek,,orion men were all big and bald in enterprise but not in star trek discovery
2935,startrek,,i didnt like discovery season 1 but liked season 2 i havent watched season 3 how do you like it so far
2936,startrek,is there an actual reason im supposed to feel bad that kila marr killed the crystalline entity i feel like i missed somethinglike we know of two occasions in which lore communicated with it and coordinated with itvia lowering shields in order to kill large groups of people  the way i look at it it knew what it was doing had the enterprise let the entity live it would have gone on to kill morethe whale/krill metaphor doesnt seem to apply here  a whale isnt that intelligent and just feeds whereas the crystalline entity completely knows what its doing otherwise lore couldnt have conversations with it if it had a conscience it likely would have found another food source either that or it clearly wasnt able to survive by any other sourcein which case if the latter was true the crystalline entity would have to be killed anyway,crystalline entity rant
2937,startrek,3 episodes in: this is the horniest show ive ever seen,decided to watch tng from the very beginning and binge all 7 seasons
2938,startrek,,every time i watch the undiscovered country or the voy episode flashback i think how awesome it would have been if we would have gotten a star trek: excelsior tv show
2939,startrek,,cirroc reflects on the visitor
2940,startrek,hello friends i just started watching the series the og and over all i love the ship  i play this game called no mans sky in which you can have a ship like the enterprise and im getting a lot of inspiration from it to build mine my question to you redditors is can i have some type of tour or see like the blueprint of it or is what we see on he series all we getpd: i know there has been different ship types according to each movie/series really any will work,the enterprise tour
2941,startrek,i always felt they sold chakotay short and tom and harry were pretty much interchangeable in any scene with belanna not too far behind but it always feels like the writers just copied and pasted from some master document the interaction between chakotay and belanna who should have a much bigger and deeper backstorychakotay: i want you to get along with xx person or perform this actionbelanna: i cant do that because im too angrychakotay: thats an orderbelanna: okayend scenefor the rich characters of janeway seven and tuvok it always felt like the writers had no idea what to do with any of the others and interactions like these just feel like theyre repeated throughout the series,rewatching voyager and i am continually surprised at the belanna and chakotay interactions
2942,startrek,why is he suddenly replaced by captain kirk or was it the opposite if im going to learn why this happened in the show just let me know and dont bother telling me,i just watched the 2 first episodes of star trek 1966 and i dont quite get what happens to captain pike
2943,startrek,im finishing my first rewatch of ds9 in many years since the first time i saw it it became my favorite piece of st by a mile one of the best elements of the long story arcs that ds9 develops in contrast to the episodic nature of other st shows is how it can take a minor character and make him relevantdamar was gul dukats right hand man when dukat had been demoted and was serving as captain of a single ship he was barely a named character but he was there when dukat takes control of cardassia allying with the dominion damar remains as his faithful ally and right hand man hes marked by his loyalty to dukat the man that brought him up through the ranks damar is a proud cardassian and prone to drinking but he does his duty to dukat with great dilligencewe see the first real development of this character when dukat orders him to befriend his daughter and we see how damar is at a complete loss when dealing with civilians in any kind fashion hes used to giving orders as a soldier not being polite he tries to convince her that her father is a great man but she wont listen to him later when he finds out that ziel betrayed the cardassians he kills her and struggles to get dukat out of the station in vain with dukat gone damar this character that started out as almost irrelevant is now the puppet leader of the cardassian union the weight of the murder the lost of his mentor and the responsabilities of guiding an entire country through a brutal struggle that is killing millions of cardassians takes its tool on damar he starts to drink and his continuous loss of power within the dominion only exacerbates the situation hes now a shadow of his former self when the dominion allies with the breen damar finally realizes that the cardassians have lost favor completely and that they are now themselves a subjugated people much like they had once enslaved bajor throughout the last arc of the series damar is a main character betraying the dominion and fighting for cardassian liberationthe relationship between dukat and damar is also very interesting he seems to have been the only truly genuine friend of dukat and both cared for each other even when dukat was already in full evil prophet mode damar probably saw dukat as his mentor and dukat saw in damar the respect that he so desperately craved from everyone else tl:dr  - ds9 took a side character that was barely worth a name and through 5 seasons made him into a conflicted and loyal soldier thrust into power devoured by depression that turned him to drinking before finally redeeming himself in a way,i love how they developed the character of damar in ds9
2944,startrek,,who here would watch a show called star trek: cetacean ops im picturing an animated ld spinoff but in the art style of the original 73 animated series but with dolphins
2945,startrek,my road to star trek fandom was i think a bit unusual and yet it has greatly influenced my life the main reason my road to star trek was a bit odd was that it was 2013 and i was a 15 year-old chinese girl not the target demographic of star trek nor the right time framemy brother was watching star trek 2009 on tv and tbh i thought it looked a bit rubbish rather than sitting through the film i half listened and wikipedia-ed the synopsis this led me down the star trek rabbit-hole i was surprised how long it had been running for and how many incarnations there were i then went on youtube and found: the picard video  i loved it i had no idea who the characters were but i kept listening i eventually took the plunge and watched tng what a great first episode i was hooked hooked enough to get through the rather dubious season 1after that i watched every incarnation read loads of books wrote a few terrible fanfictions and chose to study physics at university star trek not only kindled my love of science but also shakespeare and humanityid love to hear how other people became fans and how it has impacted their lives,how did you become a star trek fan and how has it influenced your life
2946,startrek,,what will starfleet look like in thousands of years only chief obrien and wesley know the answer to that
2947,startrek,the main criticism people seem to give is that it feels like a 2 parter episode but surely thats a good thing we watch these movies because we love the series right so how can it be bad that it feels just like the seriesi dont want to start an argument with anyone i just want to understand your view point,i just saw star trek insurrection for the first time and i loved it its my favourite of the three tng movies ive seen so far but i can see that a lot of fans dont like it how come
2948,startrek,,chris pine wants tarantino’s star trek: it’s tremendously entertaining
2949,startrek,ive loved what ive watched soo far but seeing the cheap cgi instantly takes me out of my immersion i dont understand why they would destroy the model work and matte paintings for 90s cgi so where can i stream the unaltered episodes of tos also do the tng remasters also add atrocious cgi over the old effects ,after watching and loving lower decks im hungry for more trek where can i find tos with out the atrocious cgi
2950,startrek,theory about carl:spoilerpossibly being the guardian of forever doesnt necessarily exclude the possibility that carl is a qremember this scene from death wish:janeway: this was your existence before your confinement quinn: i traveled the road many times sat on the porch played the games been the dog everything i was even the scarecrow for a while janeway: why quinn: because i hadnt done it q: oh weve all done the scarecrow big deal maybe one of the mentioned things was a symbol for taking the role of the guardian /spoiler,theory about carl
2951,startrek,i mean id love to see them in shows again but with them being older now they are kinda locked into a time frame but imagine if the cast of voyager or ds9 got together to record all new adventures actually get the ent cast together and give us a proper season 5,i wish the crew would get together and record full cast audio dramas
2952,startrek,if none of the founders would hurt odo because no changeling has killed another why doesnt odo use himself as a human shield this thought occurred to me while i was watching ds9 s3e21 in the episode the romulan and cardassian  fleet fall into the dominion fleets trap  odo and garek flee in a shuttlecraft after the founder begged odo to stay and join the great link they are being chased by the dominion and their shield keep dropping just in the nick of time the main characters show up to save them why are they being attacked if the founders will protect him at their own dispense the founders let him leave the moment the dominion ships find out he is on a ship they should not attack it because if the ship is destroy he dies,question for the ds9 fan base
2953,startrek,i mean the last 2 movies of tng are terrible so maybe they tried to get films with the other crews,were there any plans for ds9 and voyager movies
2954,startrek,i just rewatched star trek 2009 for about the tenth time because i love the story especially the beginning nero has it out for spock because he claims the federation was not doing anything to save romulus but it was clear that spock was working on red matter to try to save the planet is there any literature on the subject about why spock was late to deploy the solution  i feel like there is a big chunk of neros backstory and spocks plan missing from the movie,what was ambassador spock doing before star trek 2009

2959,startrek,i am in search of the deflector systems contained within voyager displayed as a 3d drawing or model what i have gathered so far is that the two systems that being auxiliary/navigational depending on where you look and who you ask the name changes and primary/main deflector same name funny business as the aux/nav deflector have some minor and some major differences within the intrepid class those being; the main deflector has a self contained power generation system affixed after what i have come to believe is a larger version of the generalized deflector assembly  significantly changing and increasing the size of the aft end of the whole primary deflector assembly compared to the auxiliary deflector assembly  overall the primary deflector assembly has a different construction than the auxiliary assembly an msd-esk cutaway of the intrepid class that i found labels three of the functions of the systems within the auxiliary deflector assembly as graviton polarity generation field distortion amplifiers and focusing coils these descriptions moving from the aft most part of the assembly forward to right before what the diagram labels as the secondary navigational deflector emitter dishif any of you have high resolution 2d and or 3d diagrams that contain labels if 2d of the deflector systems within the intrepid nova or the sovereign class would you please either post them and mention me or message me directly with the diagrams there are several resources that i do not have access to that contain the type of diagrams i am looking for most notably the uss enterprise owners workshop manual of which contains a detailed diagram of the main deflector assembly within the ambassador enterprise-c and could potentially contain other diagrams of the deflector systems of other ship of the same era or of an era closer to what i am looking for,inquiry into ds9 voy and nem era deflector systems

2963,startrek,in the movie when speaking to a gentleman about transparent aluminum scotty gets confused on the distance from edinboro scotland to san francisco stating he had come millions of miles until bones corrects him that it was thousands not millions of miles i would assume that in the 23rd century edinboro is still in the same place this as per cannon is where scotty is from and he had to have attended starfleet academy so how the heck did he not know how far san francisco was from edinboro secondly both uhura and checkov also attended starfleet academy which is on the shore of san francisco bay alemeda as stated in the film is across the bay from san francisco i would assume alemedias is still there in the 23rd century and can probably be seen from starfleet academy so how did checkov and uhura not know where alemeda was,star trek 4: the voyage home inconsistancies

2966,startrek,currently watching this one and im struggling to make sense of the *enterprise* crews adherence to the prime directive according to memory alpha picard by interfering in the edos judicial system the entry later states pre-warp civilizations are normally off-limits yet picard states in the opening that they discovered the planet edo only just now it is never explained on what basis they are permitted to contact the planet to begin with later episodes such as who watches the watchers and first contact explain the prohibition on contact with primitive civilizations unequivocallyso what is the explanation why was the *enterprise* there in the first place for wesley to violate their laws,tng 1x08 justice making sense of the prime directive
2967,startrek,*could we make it better by using some of the elements of the plot lets find out when the balance of power is threatened in the galaxy in this remake concept of star trek v continuing the adventures of captain kirk spock bones mccoy the enterprise a crew and reimagining sybok as a powerful romulan figure *i wanted to know what your thoughts are on this its a reimagining of stv and takes it in a different direction but not too different where some of the elements from the movie are there also a question do you think the hell storyline idea from shatner wouldve made it better or worse,reimagining star trek v: the final frontier
2968,startrek,tapestry was a great episode first time around maybe it will be again,qarl
2969,startrek,ive gone through a lot lately typical covid-land stuff i decided to watch generations tonight star trek right how could i go wrong thatand that line came up and i cried and i cried and i cried i was in 6th grade when that movie was in theaters i remember very well watching it i dont remember that line this is why star trek is so important it connects the future to our present,i was never that young
2970,startrek,were always talking about the best g worst trek has to offer my list includes  tng - *the quality of life* *datas day* *face of the enemy*  ds9 - *destiny* *battle lines* *in the cards*  voy - *distant origin* *blink of an eye* *warlord*  what are some episodes you think dont see enough recognition,what are your most underrated episodes
2971,startrek,im a huge star trek fan i love everything from tos to ent but ive been having a lot of trouble getting into disco and picard i dont know why i dont like the series but i guess to me they dont feel like trek they feel more like abrams movies which i cant stand ive seen picard and  the first 2 seasons of disco and am trying to watch the 3rd but it just doesnt click is anyone else having this issue or am i just weird,needing other opinions
2972,startrek,i really loved bob picardo as the doctor on voy so recently ive been doing a deep dive into other productions that he s been a part of spoiler: there are a lot im looking to do the same for other trek actors and actresses but i have so many favourites that i couldnt possibly pick one to start with just wondering if anybody has any favourite films or tv series that other trek actors or actresses have been a part of,star trek actors in other films/tv series
2973,startrek,,i had no idea the new animated series title/concept was based on a tng episode
2974,startrek,hi folks  im about to dive into star trek for the first time - all of star trek right from the original series up until now ive only ever seen odd scenes or the very occasional tng episode that my parents might have had on in the background the idea of star trek has always sounded super appealing to me though; i love me some sci-fi world building philosophy and ethics  i also run a youtube channel and wondered if there was an opportunity there to record something interesting from the perspective of someone who is diving into star trek for the first time thats what im here to ask - as a star trek buff someone who knows and loves the shows what would you find interesting to hear from someone coming in with fresh eyes if anything  i could come at this from a few different angles something more akin to a straightforward review of each episode and what i thought of it; it could be something more directly philosophical where i discuss my thoughts or solutions on the presented dilemma for applicable episodes i realise thats not all of what star trek is; it could even be something a little gamified/puzzle solving where i try to draw out a map of the ship/galaxy/historical timeline as accurately as possible i have no idea how feasible that is thats not an exhaustive list and i come to the subreddit since someone who has seen trek might be able to think of things id simply have no idea about   i guess ill also finish with a broader question: if you could forget everything about star trek and go back and watch it all again like it was the very first time is there anything *youd* like to do with that opportunity  thanks for your time folks im sure ill be counting myself amonst the trekkies in no time  \~orpheus,what would you want to hear from someone watching all of star trek for the first time
2975,startrek,prefer the tng feel so whatever you all would recommend,finished watching original and tng should i watch voyager or ds9 next
2976,startrek,hi everyone my name is ian thomas malone im a film critic and podcast host my show estradiol illusions just realized an episode all about the pon farr which was inspired by my fascination over whether a transgender vulcan could undergo the iconic tradition we brought on three medical doctors and a trek expert to talk all about pon farr hope you enjoy ,new podcast episode on pon farr &amp; transgender vulcans
2977,startrek,im aware that writers came up with one big explanation that got something to do with picards knowledge about theta-band carrier waves but still its a weak excuse to send one of the best federation captains on a mission like this if you want your team to successfully complete a stealth mission or at least to have higher chances you need some kind of badass spy who has experience in operations like that not a bald diplomatic starship captain who long passed his physical prime from a screenwriting standpoint its the weakest part of the story in my opinion however from the inside perspective inside star trek universe it comes off like a setup to get rid of picard by someone on the federation side mostly because of a scene at the beginning when it was established that picard didnt have much of a choice this is kinda suspiciousby the way some people think that riker was kinda an asshole in this episode and yes he was to a degree but i can understand why it aint easy to keep your composure when you work with a guy like captain jellico he proved himself as a great captain but his blunt taskmaster approach can really mess with the crews moraleso what do you think,why did picard personally go on a mission in chain of command was that even necessary
2978,startrek,,til armin shimerman is the creepy silver gift box in tng haven
2979,startrek,i figured there has to be a room or warehouse somewhere in starfleet thats filled with forbidden tech and blueprints i dont think starfleet or section 31 would really destroy everything they claim toso somewhere is the tech for phasing and cloaking time travel eugenics synths and morewhat do you think happens to them in the future,the forbidden room
2980,startrek,from all the little things that bother me with trek how pop references are restricted to humanity the federation is basically the us language is never a barrier the thing that gets me thinking the most is how the holosuite is basically a god machineforget the technical details that one of those machines is capable of creating vast simulated spaces packed with people in such a life-like manner that would utterly baffle any computer scientist each of these holosuites is a supercomputer that likely has a software and hardware more powerful than every piece of machinery in nasa combined and quark has 3 of those what really gets me thinking is how the characters in these holosuites are basically alive they are so perfectly simulated with so much memory and programing going into each character that they utterly believe they are real people and i ask you if you are indistinguishable from a real human and truly believe you are a real human **what is the difference** they believe they feel emotion so whats the difference between that and actually feeling it isnt the human brain just tricked by a series of impulses and substances much in the same manner and then we get to more complicated characters such as **the doctor and vic fontaine** they are sentient what the hell is the difference by that point they are fully living organisms that feel emotions have memories and ponder their very existence if data can be regarded as an individual than so should they if anything a sentient character of a holosuite is far more of an individual than data as they are capable of experiencing things data cannot such as emotionso basically everytime you turn on the holosuite you are god playing with innocent lives,holosuites basically create life
2981,startrek,one of the things in star trek that annoys me is that starfleet has way too many rigid and ridiculous rules  its become and ineffectual bureaucracy  it makes it difficult for the crew of a starship to actually make a difference  the prime directive is one rule that annoys me  there should be exceptions to the prime directive to be able to interfere to prevent planetary disasters etc  interfering for personal gain or for the benifit of the federation should be prohibited  then you have the temporal accord  the rules against time travel  usually not using time travel is a good idea  but there are exceptions to every rule  the temporal accord didnt exist in star trek four but if it had and kirk had followed it earth would have been wiped out  so interference should be judged on a case by case basis as to whether or not its justified  having rules that say you cant do something no matter the situation is just not practical  that is one thing i like about the original series  and i dont like the original series  but they werent bogged down in rules and regulations as much  so they were able to get more done  eventually starfleet is going to have so many rules that it will become a totally ineffective organization  so they need to rethink a lot of these insane rules and get rid of most of them and rewrite the ones that are left so that they make practical sense  so let me know what you think in the comments,starfleet has too many rigid and ridiculous rules
2982,startrek,we all know that stamets isnt humble about his intelligence hes a very smart guy and he knows it everyone around him knows it and its a gag now to everyone hes at least using it in a more jokey way now but i only just realised just how smart he ishe got an offer to teach at the vulcan science academy at a time that vulcans probably still werent hugely warm to humanity its less than 2 decades after spock being bullied for being half-human and we know the vsa are exceptionally picky and also renowned for being a phenomenal science institutionbut stamets never really bragged about that id assume everyone on discovery would realise what a big thing that was for a human scientist to be invited to the vsa but he seemed pretty humble about it it also made me realise how well respected he must be and what he gave up to stay on discovery and go into the future i know hugh was there too and only be could fly the ship but stillbasically just a realisation of mine as to how intelligent stamets is,stamets offer from the vsa
2983,startrek,as a pretty big fan of both franchises the trek fan in me gets a teeny bit jealous when i watch the mandalorian a lot of it comes down to the reverence the people behind the scenes seem to have for the source material and the greater franchise probably the biggest thing from mandalorian that id want to carry over onto star trek is the careful attention to the visual canon i know its a rather nitpicky thing but sometimes it really does bug me when i notice the small changes they make in the newer shows with things that dont really need them the extra vertical ridge that now sits on the talosians heads the new makeup they use for the orions phasers shooting out bolts instead of beams pikes wheelchair being pretty much completely different even stuff like the interfaces they use in mandalorian everything just looks right the locations and sets look authentic to the established canon the visual design for every single alien species is consistent with how they looked or if theyre new how they would have looked even the various interfaces on consoles and ships didnt get an update to make them more appropriate for the quality of television today they deliberately chose to stay consistent to whats been established those crappy vector graphics do way more for me than all the hologram stuff on discovery i know its not exactly a 1:1 situation obviously the 1966 standards for a tv show were very different than for a 1977 motion picture i just wish theyd use a little more care perhaps even restraint star trek: enterprise walked that line pretty gracefully mostly the cgi gorn was pretty awful with the success mando has been enjoying i dont think the trek execs have to worry about audiences not buying it would love to hear what you guys think,maybe a learning point from the mandalorian
2984,startrek,,star trek: the kelvin borg ruined picards most iconic moment
2985,startrek,i remember *sorta* watching enterprise when it came out and not being that into it  not sure how far i got originally but im in the second season now and i am still remembering some of these episodesanywhoo i recall there was a bit of uproar over the theme and its bad  im not a hard-core star trek fan  i can deal with things i dont like  i even enjoyed voyager quite a bit  but this song is just its bad outside of the context of the show and the series  combine it with everything else and i have to ask like was someone bffs with someone who owned the rights and wanted to get them a fat paycheck or something  or did someone just sincerely think it was a good ideathat said ill leave you with some terrible trolling i did to my friend who *is* a huge star trek fan and a fan of a particular other sci-fi show,whats the deal with enterprises opening theme
2986,startrek,,she misses captain archerlike a lot
2987,startrek,can’t remember which episode it was but the premise was that that picard captures these beings on the bridge without saying anything to his crew any ideas,help finding and episode where they capture beings on the bridge without saying g a word
2988,startrek,in the first episode of season 3 we see t’pol and trip begin their first vulcan neural pressure session which was the start of their romance arc this is also the season where t’pol begins experimenting and eventually becomes addicted to trellium d i just noticed an interesting detail that i’d missed before when t’pol initially asks trip to sit down and offers him some tea he tries to politely decline by saying that he needed to shower because he still hadn’t cleaned all the trellium d off of him since we know what effects trellium d had on t’pol couldn’t we infer that this could have had something to do with her initial attraction to trip this would have been her first exposure to the compound and would have had no idea how it would affect her perhaps there was a very slight degradation of her neural pathways just being in its presence and then began to associate that sensation with being near trip lol thoughts,t’pol/trip fan theory
2989,startrek,this isn’t a hot take by any means but the political landscape the trek canon establishes in 21st century earth is fascinating it really challenged me upon first watch because the episode had me thinking “well our earth won’t look that bad in 4 years” for the entire time and then bashir and sisko slammed me for my complacency when they reflected on how different this earth was from their own frankly the idea that anyone can watch this episode or really any trek and remain complacent on political issues is baffling i don’t have that much to contribute to this conversation but this franchise just continues to blow my mind with its inspiring vision for humanity,ds9’s depiction of earth in 2024 is terrifying and seems very astute/relevant in 2020
2990,startrek,it even occasionally plays short clips from classic episodes such as *the best of both worlds* *q who* and *yesterdays enterprise* the one featured in this screen grabfrom what i found online this particular slot machine only came out about 3 months ago i found it a welcome respite from all the generic slot machines i usually walk by,mildly interesting: i came across a star trek: tng themed slot machine in las vegas
2991,startrek,so i’m fairly confident we’ll get a snw trailer after the last episode of dsc in a few weeks in fact i had a dream about the trailer nothing special but i’ll describe what i can  we start off with the bars of the tos a theme anson mount says “space the final frontier these are the voyages of the starship enterprise her mission to explore strange new worlds  etc to boldly go where no man has gone before  cut to pike saying “hit it” and the ship warping away we get a new version of the theme which in my head sounds like a cross between tos/tmp/tng and the kelvin theme then shots of spock pike number 1 the new cast aliens ships and then we get “star trek: strange new worlds” coming date 2021,strange new worlds trailer a theory
2992,startrek,this plotline of stamets finding himself an unwitting father figure to adira is actually my favorite thing happening in disco season 3 i think its very cool how they can simultaneously not show any discrimination towards stamets and culber  or reno for being gay or adira for being nonbinary but also depict a queer found family among the four or them that feels familiar and real at least to me as someone who has been peripheral to a lot of those families its also just really great for stamets growth as a character tilly was looking up to him as a mentor in the first two seasons and while they had their moments she ended up finding better mentors in michael and saru paul was just too cold and wasnt able to really warm to her when she needed him to but adira is an actual teenager and thats clearly got stamets way outside his comfort zone which is when anthony rapp really shines as an actor i dont know if the instagram posts are canon but the idea in this one  that stamets is trying to be a better dad to adira than his dad was to him just really hits home with mei hope they do more with this relationship and with adira dealing with all the memories of the tal symbiont and especially greys memories before the season is over i was a little sad to go to the mu just when all of this was starting to get interesting,stamets and adira
2993,startrek,vedek winn from the circle the one line that sums up her character so perfectly in all of trek i don’t think there is no other actor i think does a great job at making me really despise her characterstay as many days as you like…even a week if necessary,my favorite character i love to hate
2994,startrek,one of the final scenes where avery is having a breakdown because of rascism in the 1950s and his scifi story not being printed i was very impressed in the writing and acting of the whole episode also the music with the combination of the theme song and early jazz trumpet is very good,ds9 s06e13 far beyond the stars is one of the highest pinacles of acting in star trek

3016,startrek,well im in s2 right now sadly ive already been a bit spoiled but thats a given with a show this old and popular however ive managed to avoid a lot of details about later seasons and only know a bit about the things thatll happen in later seasonsand holy shit ds9 is an amazing show ive been reluctant to watch it for whatever reason but im so glad i finally do the characters have really gown on me already and it might be the only trek-show with a great first season the way it portrays issues still very real in our own society is great and thought provoking in no way does it feel like theyre lecturing me like disco likes to do and any conclusions you come to you come to on your ownoverall i think ds9 should really get a remaster as its a show that could really affect another generation in a positive way and teach morals in a non-preachy but thought provoking way to many more people outside of already established trek-fans,i just started watching ds9 and i finally get it

3022,startrek,ok so this is not the typical anti-sjw stuff we have all heard that a million times and i will say there is a relationship to this but its kind of the opposite i feel like they are crapping all over lbgtq+ rights with them especially adira first why do they have to put the two lbgtq+ people together this doesnt bother me a lot but it does feel very contrived and silly stamets experience as a gay man in the 23rd century has nothing to do with a non-binary character in the 32nd century ok in universe its kind of because of adiras fascination with the spore drive but then why do they never seem to do anything except talk about their emotions and confusion goodness me get some freaking star trek in there with the melo-drama please secondly why did he volunteer her as able to write the algorithm if he knows she can and is trying to get her to step up why doesnt he tell her to say this it felt like that whole scene was just a set up for the later they/them pronouns discussion on that not why was adira scared to tell anyone about it before stamets do you mean to tell me that in 1200 years we havent made enough progress on the trans acceptance movement on earth that its even more taboo than now what ever happened to the argument they have made in the past about doing this in the future people dont care that picard is bald or about interracial kisses this is doing the exact opposite of that i get that its supposed to kind of be a dystopian future rather than the utopia of the 23rd and 24th centuries but if this is the case you need to at least hint at some reason why we might have slid backwards maybe some new religious movement or an under-population crisis after the burn but this is a dying society not a reborn society also she always felt this way but didnt feel ok telling anyone really not even their trans boyfriendthen to get away from the woke aspect of it entirely right after this conversation they are suddenly in a music room together stamets is on the piano adira on cello then after she plays he says i didnt know you played cello then why did you guys go to the music room together you didnt question this when she got up and walked to the music room and you sat on the piano to accompany her really not when she picked up the cello rosined up her bow and got ready to playlook star trek has and hopefully always will be a perfect medium to push progressive ideas its the future where our petty issues of today are presumably resolved but this is just such a 180 on how the have successfully handled these issues before it feels like they are trying to create a bigger issue rather than try to address them here it feels like they have gotten extremely lazy with stamets character especially contrasted to cubler who has become an important character who happens to be gay instead of a character who is basically only important because he is gay and a few other things from the first episode,rant frustrations with dsc regarding adira and stamets s3e8 minor spoilers

3029,startrek,this is basically just gonna be a place for me to dump random stuff about the series thats on my mind atmseeing the somewhat polarized reaction to discovery has been a strange experience ive come out of every season of the show impressed and i think there are a few discovery episodes that rival even the best episodes of tng that being the sound of thunder and unification iiiis it as good as tng absolutely not it was never going to be as unfortunate as it might be for us i dont believe that a 90s era style of trek show could ever work in the modern entertainment climate ive always seen discovery as an attempt to create a show which was capable of becoming popular today while also being true to the series origins i can only imagine how difficult this must be to do when you do something like that youre always going to piss people off everyone has their own version of what star trek is about or what it means so its kind of impossible to please even the majority of the community and even on a more objective level this kind of transition will always leave some unfortunate artifacts in the show; i see the admittedly very messy tangle of plot lines that plague the first two seasons of evidence of thati also find the reaction to several of the series more political choices to be somewhat perplexing i know its been said before but star trek is and always has been a progressive franchise first interracial kiss first same-sex kiss why anyone was upset about star trek continuing to be that way with the gay couple and now the non-binary character is beyond me and makes me question why theyre watching the series in the first place the stock response i hear to that is oh well they didnt push it in our faces back then honestly i dont know what youre talking about i dont really see much of a difference between the way that previous series handled their more progressive areas they barely even acknowledge that theres a same sex couple in the show there wasnt some big reveal there there just was a gay couple and that was that the non-binary scene was literally: i feel like more of a they then a she oh okay ill call you they then contrast that to the anti-capitalist speech that picard goes on during first contact if a single scene of someone asking for their pronouns to be respected is pushing it in our faces but picard literally going on a speech about how much better the future is because we got rid of capitalism is not then i just dont understand what the problem is in conclusion fandoms confuse me i often find the very critical and emotional nature of reactions to recent entries in many franchises to be annoying and pretty unwarranted it really just seems like certain people are trying to find things to be angry about that doesnt mean there isnt room for constructive criticism but this kind of criticism seems pretty emotional and baseless although i do have a tendency to find things to enjoy in most of the entertainment i consume so maybe im just particularly optimistic and minimizing flaws in my head,some thoughts on modern trek

3036,startrek,i especially feel that mass murderers and slaveholders who somewhat regret what they did later on should not be prosecuted in any way,the shows handling georgiou really shows that terrible people dont need to face consequences for their atrocities if everybody just turns a blind eye i really hope that in the future real life mass murderers and slave holders will find the same acceptance as her
3037,startrek,so im a massive tng fan and i have enjoyed disco by and large until 2 things dawned on me as to why my interest is waning this season 1: they are not fleshing out the bridge crew at all i dont really know any names or arcs with the exception of detmer and frankly not enough of her i would prefer some episodes based around these characters to open up the show and kinda drop the michael/burn centred story for a bit so i can get to know the rest of the crew2: where are all the lead men i support inclusion and representation of strong women different races and species lgtb and gender fluidity but season 3 seems lob sided and i personally dont feel drawn to any male member and i miss that book seems jammed in only for michaels sake saru is still very soft for a captain and not human the admiral is just a dick so the only 2 left are colber and stamets but they dont get enough screen time eitheri wonder if im being a snowflake here but i would like to see a more balanced show and have another pike or lorca type emerge as i think they are really being missed this season🖖🏻,some observations about disco s3: spoilers

3039,startrek,,preview ‘star trek: discovery’ episode 310 with new images from “terra firma part 2”
3040,startrek,so i knew some of the plot points coming in because of following this sub namely that there was a klingon spy who had infiltrated discovery and that the captain was secretly from the mirror universe  i also knew a lot of people had negative opinions of the show early on so i was waryin the first few episodes i was intrigued but i didn’t really like any of the characters save for maybe captain georgiou note i’m gonna refer to prime georgiou as captain georgiou and mirror as emperor georgiou  i think the emperor did give a good critique of burnham in one of the later episodes “you don’t follow through”  i found michael unbearable in the first few episodes  they were headstrong know-it-all but then mopey and hateful  they were almost the worst combination of human and vulcan you could think of  intelligent and logical but their emotions took over enough to shoot their fucking captain  and then their emotions took over enough to be depressed about and push everyone around them away  seemingly it was intended from the beginning that michael would open up more to their crew mates and their own humanity and learn what it means to be human  so over time i grew to like michaela writing problem i had with some of the characters was that they pivoted too quickly  besides the security officer that they offer early on  like lorca was every bit a terran imperial officer at first but he softens rather quickly and seemingly with no real rhyme or reason then once in the mirror universe he immediately pivots back to mustache twirlingly evil  this frustrates me bacause i had started to like lorca  i thought when he mentioned that he had attempted a coup against the emperor that he meant like he was trying to make positive changes in the empire  nope  he’s even more of a xenophobe than the emperor who genocided the klingons and ate kelpian for dinner  he was a misogynist and groomed mirror burnham into a sexual relationship to get to the emperor  dude’s just a creep  there is a small part of me that hopes to see prime lorca at some point and that the admiral is wrong about his inability to survive the mirror universe  saru is seems to have gone from a minor role to a much more pivotal one fairly quickly  his initial mistrust of burnham seems to be only partially founded then it’s like he suddenly is cool with her again like a light switch  as the season progresses i grow to really like saru though to the point that he’s probably my favorite characteri’m not going to say too much else but i liked ash tyler’s and michael burnham’s relationship  i thought they wrapped it up pretty well with their last scene together before landing on the klingon home world  though i feel like it must have been devistating to michael for tyler to go with l’rellthoughts  does anyone else feel like some of the characters pivoted to quickly,i finally watched disco season 1 and just wanted some people to talk about it with

3047,startrek,there are so many episodes where something is dowloaded/uploaded in star trek and then lost/moved from its original location this usually pertains to a hologram i know holgrams are huge and having multiple copies of the same program would take up a lot of spacebut lets take the doctor travelling to the alpha quadrant as an example surely there is some sort of backup function they send him off and leave themselves without a chief medical officer for so long i seem to recall a line in voyager about why they cant do this but it never really made sense to me it just seems liek a convenient plot device to me rather than a genuine technical limitation,why doesnt copy and paste exist in star trek

3058,startrek,see when the federation put a band on all ai i think but anyways with all the ais band wouldnt that mean all those holograms like the doctor from voyager as well and not forgetting that his program was tampered with by kes and the doctors diagnostic program who sacrificed himself to enhance the the doctor yeah the doctor lost his memory but had his program so enhance that he can now learn and have better social skills then the other emh doctors mark 1 in fact i think he went past the emh mark all of them he even became the ech the emergency captain hologram program&amp;#x200b;i also dont understand how no one even thought that the doctor enhanced program would be good with the new starflets androids they even stated that the doctors ai was even more beyond then any ai theyve seen it was him and beverly crusher that fighered out how to remove borg parts and dont worry about kes seeing how her species has an incredibly short lifespan she would be dead by now from extreme old age,about that band on ai in star trek: picard
3059,startrek,so as i have posted before i am watching voyager for the first time from start to finish in season 7 episode 7 body and soul captain janeway stated that they completed their maintenance layover at a maldorian station at the beginning of season 7 episode 8 nightingale captain janeway stated that lieutenant torres has finally convinced her that they cant put off a major maintenance overhaul what were you doing during the maintenance layover at a stationi know what it is like to have a vehicle and a crew i know that there are some things that the crew can do in terms of maintenance by themselves in the middle of nowhere but what my crew could do to my vehicle at a maintenance bay far surpased what they could do by themselves so what the hell are you doing janeway if it was in reverse order and she touched down on a planet and performed some maintenance then the next episode they were passing by this station and couldnt pass up the opportunity to perform an overhaul but it wasnt reverse and just goes to show another example of subpar direction i am not familiar with the said terms or the maldorians so if someone is well versed in star trek maintenance could add something to educate me i would appreciate it,voyager continuity issues again

3065,startrek,bar association may not not the *best* trek episode ever but its my absolute favorite makes me so happy radical obrien rom quoting marx that one scene where worf complains to odo about lax security and odo whips out a list of all the security breaches on the enterprise fun low-stakes morality play in space,he was more than a hero he was a union man

3075,startrek,,star trek discovery was not the first trek to deal with gender and lgbtq issues
3076,startrek,star trek has featured nazis three times but hasn’t featured any german characters in the future settings let alone any positive ones star trek is popular in germany and i’m wondering maybe in a new series what position on a starship a german could fill that wouldn’t seem too stereotypically ‘german’ maybe star trek is so popular in germany because every position suits the german mentality   i always liked that in star trek the humans are better versions of humanity but are still humans there are still irish and african americans and dr mccoy and i’d like to think there would still be germans,german character
3077,startrek,,ds9 remastered battle from sacrifice of angels in 4k
3078,startrek,i have three running hypotheses about this:* carl is a benign member of the q continuum testing georgiou and showing her how much shes changed from her time in the prime universe this plot could be similar to tapestry in tng or a kind of *christmas carol* storyline intended to shift georgious moral compass * the mirror universe shown in this version is in the nexus and is a dream world that lures georgiou back to being in her element of being the emperor of the terrans * carl is a time agent of some kind and he and/or kovich are in some way involved in a scheme to change the history of the terran empire by sending georgiou back in time to alter the destiny of the terran empire all of these could be possible and not mutually exclusive - but its also quite possible that carl is supernatural on his own without an affiliation with the q continuum and that the mirror universe beyond the door isnt the nexus at all,is carl a q or is the mirror universe do-over actually the nexus or both is the mirror universe return part of the temporal cold war
3079,startrek,this site:says it was yesterday says its only going to be screened once but still lets you donate it doesnt explain if you actually get to watch a recording of it if you donatedoes anyone know how to see it either for free or if that link still lets me watch itor anyone who watched it was it any good ,where to see yesterdays star trek: the next election zoom thingy

3086,startrek,i know there is a contingent of people here who love ent and all the power to you but back in 2002 when this show aired i think they had a real opportunity to diverge all the captains had been caucasian and american up to this point except for picard being french all the captains were male except for janeway why did they have togo with another white male american who was pivotal to founding the ufp i mean i dont have anything against white people but as a franchise that prides itself on moving the needle on progressive issues i feel like having a show lead be yet again another male amerivan was just a choice by committee they were trying to hit the demographic button  whereas shows like ds9 and voyager did something different star trek should want to be more representative there are millions of fans who are not of the american male persuasion and honestly it just felt forced that here we had another white male american saving the galaxy they could have gone with an asian man or an arab american east indian something different instead we got a dork whose defining characteristics were extreme naivete and a passion for water polo in any case this is old news now but it just had to be said i cant relate at all with archer and i wish they had gone a different route with the ascendancy of china and that half the human population is made up of those groups it was just a lack of imagination anyway bring on the downvotes lol,some of you will be bothered by this but did we really need another male american captain in ent

3089,startrek,riker left troi for postings that would further his career thats why their relationship ended pre-enterprise  all glory to troi for ending a passionate relationship amicably enough to stay friends she is an excellent counselor  during the course of tos riker decided to stay on the enterprise forsaking other postings that would further his career this means he loved being numbah two more than he loved furthering his career and more than he loved troi  that must have hurt troi to know where you were on someones list and it was below so many things  at the very least she knew she was good enough not to accept being last to be picked no wonder she wouldnt date him while he was on the enterprise  nobody should have to play second fiddle or third  i bet once he got other postings and fulfilled his ambition he was less insufferable and only then would she have contemplated a relationship with him,why troi wasnt with riker on the enterprise
3090,startrek,a what if series with the central premise being instead of the vulcans having first contact with earth its one of the other many species each season would be self-contained and the first episode would introduce the main protagonist for that seasoni think one of the reasons i like this idea so much is because you can do anything you want storytelling wise you can focus on any era you want and you can introduce new characters or you can revisit characters everybody knows and loves this idea was stolen/inspired by a recent trekculture videomy other idea is to do kind of a star trek jag type thing but the gag there is they never actually win a case because every crazy explanation is actually true my evil doppelganger committed the crime not me it wasnt me but future me who committed the crime,my idea for a new star trek tv series-star trek: first contact

3092,startrek,,when did swearing start getting printed/shown in non-canon
3093,startrek,show would follow cadets at star fleet academy but mostly as the b storyline the a storyline would be a starfleet holodeck history course where the cadets are placed in the greatest moments in starfleet history wolf 359 from another ship’s perspective  no one says they have to be survivable missionscan be any ship any captain war game against the m5 computer easy lots of stars would want to be on star trek but can’t commit to entire season but also not want minor role now they can be captain of exciting battle and be lead of episode would be a chance to see other starfleet captains being clever,idea for star fleet academy show
3094,startrek,nothing else i was just rewatching some episodes the other day and thought discovery is a much more appropriate name for the ship and the show especially in the first two seasons it also keeps the kirk made the enterprise special vibe from tos intact rather than it just being a legendary namedont change anything else come up with an alternative name for disco done,star trek: enterprise should have been called star trek: discovery
3095,startrek,now i recognize original tabasco  its always unique given its bottle  the orange sauce next to it makes it almost seem like cholula hot sauce except that the traditional wooden knob top is missing it seems to have the same hearty thickness as cholula at any rate but it could also be a hot butter-based wing saucethere is a taller third bottle though with a green top on one of the bottles  now it could be tabasco green but i think thats a wrong guess  the bottles are standardized on all of the tables so why would anyone always buy the original size of one tabasco but the larger size of the other  if we factor out tabasco green then what hot sauce could it be    please keep in mind that a restaurant would probably buy hot sauces by the case so a boutique rare hot sauce that you might find in a hot sauce store just isnt likely  in terms of balance given the other two heats /flavors /consistencies it could be a sriracha sauce but i just dont recognize the brand  also given how sisko sr loves to cook with items from earth lets factor out an off-world 24th century brand im including a screen shot of the table and it shouldnt be any kind of spoiler   all opinions are welcome please,ds9- siskos fathers restaurant on earth s:4 e:11 part 2- what hot sauces are on the tables

3097,startrek,so ive started trying to watch tng as my first trek beyond the new movies and i know youre not supposed to watch every episode in order but i have dont really believe in cherry picking shows either the whole things largely good or its largely bad you can point to episodes youre not a fan of or skip stuff on rewatches but for my first run i like to get the whole thing and ive encountered an almost uncanny valley effect with the show  i dont want to call the actors wooden but theyre definitely very proper they speak very clearly their accents impeccable and theres pretty much no slang as far as ive gotten and the ship is just incredibly clean the sets are very well put together but they dont really feel lived in theres no wear and tear anywhere and i get that the whole aesthetic of the franchise is supposed to be very pristine but it just ends up feeling off to me like the world isnt lived in and really its just a theme park populated by puppets being paraded around before me under the pretence of humanity or whatever race they may be hell if anything data feels like the most realistic character to me because he doesnt try and be human in the slightest hes just very clearly robotic and theres no expectation of humanity  im really sorry if this is coming off as harsh or anything im finding it hard to describe this odd feeling to others is this something anyone else has experienced and does it get better as it goes or should i just watch ds9 instead as that seems to be more recommended at least by the people i know,tng uncanny valley

3118,startrek,this is a bit more philosophical but also relating to logistics of running a societymuch like the potential problems and solutions relating to federation-style meritocratic economy no matter how idealistic how wide spanning or self-isolating going between recent episodes of the new season of *star trek discovery* and old episodes of *ds9* 》in particular those of interactions between dr bashir and sloan 》odos commentary insightful as it is often comedically charged and well-intentioned in his critique of *the solids* and implications regarding similarity with other great powers specifically them always and maybe inevitably developing such autonomous divisions in the name of survival security or greater good operating freely and perhaps too freely even as far as other offical and publically known and accountable intelligence -gathering analytics and logistics agencies and other more action-prone operation services of such go  as was the official outlook from federation and starfleet which seem to have been mostly turning a blind eye knowingly  fully aware of such a glaring blemish upon their otherwise and indeed deservingly spotless reputation of putting ethics amd ethical considerations into practice 》and significant ethical issues with siskos more radical actions taken for the greater good and/or not at all more simplistically in the line of duty as outlined as intended for the uniform as it were concepts of loyalty and potentially of knowingly betraying your own principles and things you believe in and fighting for on occasion a desperate occasion for the necessity of securing a better tomorrow where such ideals could exist perhaps in a way explaining how some of the more contradictory orders and systems of beliefs and of governancethings they seem to overlook or compartmentalize all too well could have possivly come to arise in the klingon culture  or how they possibly couldve been justified or explained away to being with  to a degree a civilisation  seemingly  in some respects at least  almost destined to fail from the outset,did section 31 ever have a point in the nature of their existence even in their successes

3124,startrek,in star trek discovery season 3 when the uss discovery arrives at federation hq ensign tilly mentions that some of the ships hulls are comprised of holographic projections and some are organic in nature what could the theoretical benefits be of an organic hull or one comprised out of holographic projections rather than a traditional metal alloy based hull,hypothetical benefits of organic and holographic hulls
3125,startrek,so if you watched the second star trek film with chris pine in it kelvin timeline into darkness i believe they begin on a mission to stop a volcano from wiping out a primitive alien race that has barely invented the wheel the easter egg here is that the planet was nibiru on the kelvin timeline things seem to be similar but alternate in this khan battle kirk goes into the warp core and gets irradiated instead of spock so perhaps this is a hidden jab at the theory that our history was altered by the aliens from nibiru and they were seen possibly even influencing our religions which is why so many cave paintings depict space craft or even an additional planet in our solar system in voyager season 3 a late episode in the season has the voth which are reptilian more evolved than us but they left earth and lost that history another jab at science theories based on the missing link between humans and primates rhesus factor not present in rh negative their religion denied this science just as we see in reality ourselves at times i love those kinds of easter eggs any thoughts other examples,distant origins and hidden meanings
3126,startrek,tos - an aspirational look at a better more enlightened future for humanity it was about exploration and the most noble human drives tng - an updated look at a more enlightened future and an exploration of utopia it was also about space exploration and the scientific worldview ds9 - asks the question how do you preserve a utopia in the face of those with totally different values and is it even worth preserving is it even really a utopia to begin with the show is not about the exploration of space but about the exploration of consequences voyager - asks how do you maintain your values when you’re all alone and survival is paramount again a focus on the utopia how enlightened are you when you’re running out of supplies and no one has your back what are you willing to sacrificeenterprise - how do you build a better future from the world we have it showed us the early days of the utopia so that we could better relate to it discovery - is it about a better future not really especially in season 3 a sort of better future is just a backdrop not a focus is it about exploration nope that’s not really a focus either is it about us a mirror to our social issues like so much good sci fi is nope it doesn’t seem interested in commenting much beyond representation in its casting what is this show about what is it trying to say,what is discovery about

3132,startrek,my apologizes if this has been discussed in here previously one huge question ive always had about first contact is that the borg sphere that went back to the 21st century is bombing the site of cochranes warp ship in order to stop first contact with the vulcans why they had transporters on that sphere because they beamed over to the enterprise so why didnt they just beam down and assimilate the people on the ground in the first place,star trek first contact issue
3133,startrek,in the movie there was this starfleet officer who had a dying daughter khan saves her by giving her his blood in return that he blows up star fleet london headquarters for khan the problem is the character and his daughter are never seen again why was that&amp;#x200b;is seems odd that that plot line was dropped&amp;#x200b;by the way star trek into darkness thought a well made movie is one of the worst star trek movies ever done the movie is one of the few films that proves jj abrams is such a shallow director and why orci and kurtzman should have stuck with writing transformers,star trek into darkness plot point that was dropped
3134,startrek,burnham obviously loves the federation and what it stands for but she often comes into conflict with starfleets idealsburnhams tactics of regularly going rogue defying orders sparking out her captain to fire on a klingon ship are the way s31 officers would do things not to mention her weird mother-daughter relationship with georgiou and complete willingness to overlook her many many genocides and that nothing about georgiou even vaguely fits with the federation&amp;#x200b;i dont think she would like it or even approve but i reckon she would make a good covert agent being allowed to do things not necessarily under the perview of starfleet,potentially unpopular opinion: burnham would suit section 31

3142,startrek,the story was great and really held my attention but the premise seemed too much like what tng had already done several times before just with a different anomaly then to find out that the whole of tng was in a sense just humanity being evaluated by q just kind of felt disconcerting to mei may be way off but it just didnt feel like the kind of finale the series deserved,i just finished tng:all good things so ive finished all of tng did anyone else think this episode was kind of a letdown

3147,startrek,i have a theory of what happened in the burn what made me realise all this was the discussion when &gt;saru and the others&lt; talk about the &gt;distress signal&lt; they received from the &gt;kelpien ship&lt;saru &gt;that it was a few years prior&lt; to the burn and that &gt;they were conducting scientific research on dilithium&lt; ring any bells what exploded during the burn &gt;wasnt the carrier signal&lt; distorted by the nebula &gt;the music and the wave that carried the whatever exploded the dilithium&lt; too many things happened at once for them to be just coincidentallong story short &gt;i have a feeling that it was a failed science experiment those kelpien did in the nebula that was somehow amplified by sb-19 and carried out to the galaxy with the distress signal isnt the distress signal on loop so it was basically constantly repeating while sb-19 was supposed help deliver the signal due to the subspace problems mentioned earlier&lt; the war the destroyed subspace that they mentioned i said long story short but that wasnt really short hah,my theory of what happened
3148,startrek,trekkie trackerlive long and watch a lot of star trek i have just spent the last 2 years developing the ultimate spreadsheet for trekkies i built it out of love for everything star trek and cant live without it basically it is an excel spreadsheet that tracks everything star trek**the website link attached is to my spreadsheet compiled in xlspadlock that i have been building for the last few years that acts as a detailed personal database of everything we have ever watched in the entire star trek franchise** the database is currently up to date and includes lower decks picard series 1 and provision for series 2 and discovery 1-3 with already provision for season 4 because it has been announced and all the short treks are included as well as all the episodes of after trek for discovery series 1 and the ready room with will wheaton for picard discovery series 3 and the beginning middle and end of the first series of lower decksall of the titles in the database are all hyper linked to memory alpha as well so you can check up on the details before or after you record the details about the show you just watched including if it is a favourite how many times you watched it and any notes or comments you want to makeand i have created something called my treks this is a shareable database built into the application so as a fan finds something new and interesting for star trek they just add it to the database and on a monthly basis i intend to push out an update with everyones contributions the beauty of this spreadsheet is that updated compiles easily restore your existing personal database which is automatically saved and stored separately every time you close the applicationi would love some feedback and if you find anything wrong i will fix it,my trekkie tracker - a compiled excel spreadsheet database designed to keep track of everything you watch on star trek

3152,startrek,the romulans have used artificial black holes to power their warp drive for a long time  with most of the dilithium destroyed by the burn the federation could switch to using singularity warp cores instead of antimatter  its a known technology  the federation has known about it since the tng era  so why not use it to replace their warp drive so they dont need dilithium,why doesnt the federation switch to using singularities to power their warp drive
3153,startrek,seems to me both vger and the whale probe were a case of the enterprise crew being in the right place and the right time to cope with bothhow do you think the alternative enterprise crew would have coped also what would happen if they both turned up at the same time,how did the kelvin universe cope with vger &amp; the probe

3156,startrek,im re-watching star trek 2009 and i came across something that does not make any sense about halfway through the movie spock as captain does not want to go after pike kirk objects strongly hitting officers in his argument spock then says get him off my ship and throws him in an escape pod onto a barren icy planet where he has to crawl out and is narrowly by blind luck avoided being eaten by a polar bear thingy i assume they have trajectory so spock as his first command as being captain commits kirk to a barren planet miles from help a narrow chance of survival kirk even says spock marooned me here for mutiny again a death sentence or a higher chance than zero so intentionally putting him in harms way just to expedite punishment am i wrong i am pretty high ,confused in star trek 2009 does spock sentence kirk to death
3157,startrek,from tos to picard its always rough in the first season generally the best season comes later in the series id like to hear thoughts on which series you think had the best beginning season and why my personal favorite first season is ds9 i liked the beginnings of story arcs in addition to character development prophets and wormhole discovery in the first episode so much better than were out here to start exploring,first seasons of all st series

3163,startrek,as an avid fan and serial re-watcher i must say that i love lwaxana troi i know that at first she can seem downright cringeworthy but man is she fun she is completely in her own world her own element and she owns every scene that she is in her love of life and the people in it is amazing her regal attitude everything about her is fantastic i have been watching tng alot lately i find such comfort and delight in her character i dont know if anyone will ever revive that character but for all our sakes i hope if it happens they remember to bring that same spiriti am lawaxna troi daughter of the fifth house holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed who are you this is the energy we all need to enter 2021 with,i love lwaxana troi

3166,startrek,i havent watched a lot of tos before this but after the latest discovery episode i went out of my way to watch city on the edge of forever  after i finished watching it it just struck me that its great that new trek content is making me go back and watch older trek that i havent seen before  im sort of more tempted to watch the whole series now tooi quite liked the episode and given how long these episodes are and the setting it felt more like an old movie  for a fully honest review id have to say that the setup in the first 5 or so minutes of the episode felt a bit clunky  but a mad mccoy running around terrorizing the locals made up for itkirks dilemma was fun to watch unfold spock had a lot of great lines and the whole plot of the episode was well put together but i found the machine spock built just showing them exactly what they needed to see a bit convenient  although i admit i might have missed something in the dialoguethe ending was great with kirk not even responding to the guardian and after a brief pause just saying: lets get the hell out of here and then they just leave   oh yeah and edith keeler was a hottie i would have had a big dilemma on my hands in kirks situation toofor full disclosure/context i have watched the first 3-4 tos episodes before but nothing beyond,discovery lead to me watching city on the edge of forever
3167,startrek,disclaimer: if you like this episode great i respect that completely i didn’t and want to vent i just finished it and i don’t think an episode has irritated me this much in a while this has to be one of the stupidest trek episodes ever- everyone just has the idiot ball throughout except seven tuvok and torres janeway really put the life of her digital boyfriend over the lives of the doctor kim and paris instead of shutting down the damn program and then the episode has the audacity to make that bs sympathetic can we talk about the unfortunate implications in this and the first fair haven ep janeway got rid of micheal’s digital wife destroyed all memory of her and fully reprogrammed him because she viewed him as fictional and not real like most holodeck characters then in this ep she’s treating him and the other fh characters as more important than her crew despite them being able to be fixed like paris did between episodes also the fact any holodeck character can be taken out of the program via the holo emitter which really should only work for the doctor and given sentience through a malfunction at least in tng when moriarity became sentient there was a better described reason the entire thing not only seems stupid but is really uncomfortable the more you think about it especially in the light of what other flesh characters have done to holodeck characters in this franchise- you’re telling me they were all capable of sentience with the right computer problems i mean even just between these two voy eps it’s frightening because janeway killed the dude’s wife and wiped everyone’s memories- wasn’t she sentient too then the doctor is supposed to be a special case and i love that but these episodes cheapen the concept and don’t even do it right due to contradictions just awful episodes in my opinion,voyager’s ‘spirit folk’ rant
3168,startrek,when i learned that the romulan prophecy in pic was that there were sentient machines bent on removing biological life i assumed that there was a twist incoming where they could reason with the machines or otherwise negotiate with them it would be a nice trek-y story to find some way of working to communicate with and understand these mechanical life forms so far  from ourselvesinstead the romulan xenophobia was essentially justified because there were evil robots willing to exterminate biological life whats the point of having a story where the moral is yes the bad guys were justified in their crusade against artificial life but it doesnt matter because we stopped the apocalypse in the nick of time why not have a story where the romulans jumped to conclusions and unnecessarily deployed violence against innocents when instead a good-faith attempt at communication would have workedi think the reason this especially annoyed me was that following dis season 2 which gave us two seasons in a row with a senient ai enemy both of which were both pretty cliche and star trek had already perfected with its borg stories,the weirdest choice star trek: picard made was having the evil romulan cult be essentially correct about everything

3173,startrek,my dad brought up that he would love to see a star trek and star wars crossover ive also always been a fan of both more trek the older i get and i personally feel like trek content keeps getting better while wars keeps getting worse overallall that aside how do you think they could pull it off storywisemy approach would be to essentially make the tkon empire = the galactic empire because they are both the empire and they both existed a long time ago also trek canon states the tkon used planets as outposts and could move them through space — sounds like a death star / starkiller base to me anyway ill probably get downvoted into oblivion for mentioning the other star show here but imo its a fun idea,how do you think a trek/wars crossover could best work likely for fun non-canon like in a comic book event or something

3191,startrek,so with mirror universe and timelines being the rage at the moment i wanted to discuss and collectively figure out how many different universes and timelines actually exist aside from the prime mirror new mirror and kelvin universes talked about in discovery  that got me to thinking  every time travel episode is creating a timeline split and thus a new universe that goes ignored exists where things can unfold differentlylike star trek iv for example  after they time travel back from earth with humpback whales they created a new timeline where earth survives the probe and humpback whales are no longer extinctstar trek first contact creates a universe where the borg took the place of vulcans at first contact and had assimilated earthcant even begin to share how many temporal incursions happened during voyager or enterprisethe more you look at it it seems the less prime the prime universe looks,star trek: the multiverse
3192,startrek,,how star trek: insurrection reflected the conflict of reality
3193,startrek,so i have spent a little over the last 12 months watching tng ds9 and voyager nothing like a pandemic and some serious paternity leave to get through it all they are all great tbh tng was probably the weakest strongest characters though but i am not writing this to list my preferences my biggest problems with each series though are:tng: lack of over arching story archds9: the religious subplot didnt interest mevoyager: the first season or two should have definitely dealt with the conflict between the two crewsone thing i have noticed since watching discovery is the difference in pace and loudness the starships/stations of tng ds9 and voyager are so quiet and peaceful the glimpses of space out the window were at first quite claustrophobic but the darkness and the humming of the spaceship fills me with such a sense of tranquility i remember hearing an interview with one of the members of pink floyd in which he described the use of silence in their music i think the three star trek series i mentioned do the same,missing the peacefulness of the starships already - just finished voyager tng and ds9 after 12 months of watching

3197,startrek,i have been rewatching some of the very best of tng i have always been a massive fan of captain picard his sensibilities his logic leadership and compassion i’m rewatching episode after episode and i am reminded of and just cannot believe the absolutely brilliant things he says even in a throw-away quiet moment there will be something profound that he says it’s really some next-level stuff that i’ve not seen on tv since tng do we have any idea who exactly was writing for the picard character during these episodes  i am trying to understand if there was a writers’ room if perhaps there was one person who was always trusted with these crazy picard speeches do we know how that worked and who wrote this stuffi seriously want to know more about those writers,do we know any details of the brilliant writing behind tng’s captain picard
3198,startrek,i dont know if anyone remembers but posted that i started watching ds9 for the first time a little while ago and ive just hit *this* episode someone did warn me but i still didnt quite expect the impact itd have on me i started tearing up before the intro music even started playing theres been episodes throughout the various series that made me emotional before but nothing quite like this one whew,so ive just seen the visitor for the first time
3199,startrek,when glasses says “yor here” and explains that he apparently crossed through the kelvin universe as well as time traveling i was convinced he was telling culber that discovery came from the kelvin-verse rather than “yor”  i get that i might just be thick but i seriously feel like in draft that script should have called for some rewording,i just want to say whoever named one of the characters in terra firma pt 1 is a stupid head spoiler

3210,startrek,i grew up on tng and the rest of star trek too and i love patrick stewart and i cannot for the life of me enjoy this show its mediocre television at best and absolutely terrible as star trekfor example there was a scene where picard was repulsed by the former borg on the artifact because of his assimilation ptsd but after seeing how hugh was helping them reclaim their lives it helped him work through some things and see the former borg as victims like him instead of monsters overcoming prejudice in space is a classic pillar of star trek and i was glad to see this in here unfortunately it was a 20 second throwaway scene and the former borg are never shows as anything but mindless zombies for the rest of the season that scene could have been expanded to an entire episode of tng and it probably would have been one of the best if it werethen we have 7 of 9 grappling with the idea of taking over all the drones on the artifact to fight the romulans and ultimately save all their lives ends vs means in space another pillar of good star trek but again this idea is explored for about 10 seconds and then discarded and never really returned to its a convenient bit of deus ex machina disguised as a themethere were a lot of little scenes too which bothered me in a star trek context it just did not depict a future i could be hopeful for and thats probably the most important characteristic of star trekand for my last example of why its bad star trek there is the part where one of the androids does a mind meld with agnes to try and clarify what her vision meant maybe they were wrong about the message maybe the advanced synthetics are peaceful and it was the fear of the unknown that caused the romulans to think they are destroyers nope same message just stated more clearly this time this could have been the most star trek part of the series if it was done differentlyand even if it was the same story in a different not star trek show it still wasnt great the main plot was a bad mass effect rip off and the ship was extremely boring i dont even remember its name and i finished the show last night i liked some of the characters rios and his holograms for example  but others were pretty bad the guy with the sword for example you could remove all his lines and replace him with a dog and it would not change a thing about the rest of the show another bit of deus ex machina disguised as a character this time hugh was well done but under used there could have been some really interesting plotlines about him exploring what it means to survive being assimilatedthere was so little to like about this show and it has patrick fucking stewart in it i dont understand it,massive spoilers i dont understand how star trek picard was this bad

3226,startrek,hi allfirst up and out the gate im a tng guy the pilot episode of tng is the first memory i have of watching tv with my dad i was hooked movies tos ds9 voy and ent ive watched em all time and again ive bought models learned some klingon im a trekkiethe kelvin movies for me are like some kinda grotesque sideshow its almost as if the events depicted are being remade as a holonovel and were watching the result too flashy too gaudy and none of it makes sense it exists and its a giant cartoon but its not for meimagine my excitement at learning a contemporary big budget star trek series was in the works man i couldnt wait i had this feeling that trek could rival the mcu or game of thrones in terms of marketability and outright mania the diversity of stories and adventures available within the trek universe is staggering then i heard bryan fuller was on board wow an actual genuine tv talent someone who understands budget visual and story telling appeal nicolas myer holy shit then word of an anthology series different crew different setting each season yeeesssssss hook it to my veinsthen fuller left then alex kurtzman came aboard ok ok it could still be good right then news that the anthology idea had been jettisoned this would be a prequel oh no oh lord no i had zero faith in kurtzman respecting canon i was right i watch discovery i will continue to watch discovery but im not a fan i watch because its trek but in so many ways it lets itself down and im getting tired of coming onto trek forums and looking to engage in a reasonable discussion about discovery without its defenders acting like spoiled children or explaining plot holes using their own head canon were fans weve invested hundreds of hours in this franchise its universe and its characters were allowed be miffed when somone produces a serious that is totally disrespectful of that franchise i know people harp on about this - but yes michaels crying its absolutely ridiculous for comparison; imagine laforge shedding a tear when dressed down by picard or bones or odo weeping because sisko said he didnt trust him remember ds9 remember how all the characters felt like they cared and loved one another without saying it in every episode or hugging starfleet is a para-military organisation these people are soldiers and explorers they know how to comport themselves in front of their superiors her continued insubordination and her crews tolerance of same is ludicrous the mycilical network is farcical roller-coaster turbo lifts the set design of discovery is lazy as fuck man glowing corridors awesome the mirror universe is a cheap played out concept enough give us something new man were in the 31st century now man new races new empires new tech give me new ideas new worlds new species new sci-fiction spins show me a q joining star fleet lets see what lies outside the milky way lets deal with black holes strange new phenomena i dont wanna see fucking tilly with a new hair do acting evulz i could go on and on ranting about my feelings on discovery but largely i feel disappointed let down they had a perfect opportunity here to move forward a post nemisis and post kelvin incursion timeline 25th century new ship new crew and they wasted it so now we have picard instead best not get me started there look - in short; i love trek even when i hate it im glad theres trek on tv but discovery is such a wasted opportunity it could have been so amazing but instead i guess ill tune it to hear about how micheal burnham is the only person capable of saving the universe for the 33rd time in a row then watch her cry for a bit goddamnit kurtzman,my hopes for discovery

3228,startrek,netflix does not show me the new episode  would anyone kindly send me the link to the episode itself on netflixps i am in egypt and i watched all other episodes in their normal time on netflix this is a first,dis 3x09 not aired on netflix
3229,startrek,rest in peace tommy lister/ klang,although he only appeared in the enterprise pilot
3230,startrek,i know it takes places after the temperal war  and that they destroyed all of their time travel technology  but to hell with the temporal accord  you dont just sit back and follow treaties as the galaxy goes to hell  there should be exceptions to the temporal accord  like preventing giant disasters  they should have learned from the prime direction that having a rule that says you cant do something even when things are going to hell is stupid  they may have destroyed their time travel technology  but the knowledge on how to create that technology still exists  which means they could build new time travel tech if they wanted to  or just do the slingshot maneuverso they should have gone back in time and stopped the burn  to not do so when they can is a crime  even if doing so breaks some ridiculous rules  doing the right thing should be more important then rules and regulations  thats why starship captains often break the prime directive to help less advanced civilizations  it may not be following the rules but it is the right thing to do  so they should have used time travel to stop the burn  let me know what you think in the comments,why didnt the federation use time travel to stop the burn
3231,startrek,voyager is my favourite star trek series of all however when someone criticizes it or points out its flaws i dont cry sexism cause it has a female captain or whatever i realize that they have valid reasons to dislike it even if i dont agree with them this is where discovery fans super piss me off no i dont hate it cause its new or cause it has a black lead or whatever other idiocy you want to pull i hate it cause the dialogue with its overly dramatic lines and profanities feels like its been written by some edgy teenager posting star trek fanfic on the internet also i hate to say this but both sonequa martin green and booker are terribly bland actors the fact that they killed off michelle yeoh and ariram only to replace them with duplicates feels like something out of a bad indian soap opera  i am south asian btw so am not saying that to be racist; our soap operas are ridiculous also why are they trying to make us sympathize with emperor georgiu shes morally worse than gul dukat technically also her long list of titles is so clearly ripping off daenerys from game of thrones am i the only one who sees all these problems in that series theres no way this is a good star trek series,unpopular opinion:discovery has imptoved somewhat but its still a pretty bad series
3232,startrek,watched star trek with the dad as a wee little pint so don’t remember too much and now as an adult decided to watch from the start after tos all movies tng those movies finally on dsn and really didn’t like it was worried i would have to drudge through 7 seasons but in season 3 and am really enjoying all of the characters except bashir haha so happy after the chemistry of the first two series i am loving this one and am excited to keep going through all of star trek awesome side effect: me and my dad have so much to talk about and bond over its really awesome,after 25 seasons i love dsn
3233,startrek,they turned an entire race into one dimensional religious zealots always obsessed with honour at least the tos klingons had diversity the tribbles episode crew were a bit more conniving while the guy from day of the dove was a much more disciplined person,unpopular opinion : i hate tng era klingons and much prefer tos era ones
3234,startrek,one of the dominion founders infiltrated and sabotaged the defiant since the dominion founders are shape-shifters anyone acting suspicious or going alone would be questioned and probably ejectedsorry for the grammatical errors im still typing this while watching the episode,s3 e26 of deep space nine the adversary is exactly like among us
3235,startrek,,friday enterprise actor tommy tiny lister found dead by friend after experiencing covid symptoms
3236,startrek,who do you think would play the younger versions of the rest of the cast,sara mitich could play a young dr crusher on a tng reboot or a kelvin universe tng movie
3237,startrek,anyone know what sunglasses barclay was wearing in inside man,reg barclay
3238,startrek,like i get that most everyone from earth is generally atheistic in the enlightened future but why has there like never been a character named like cohen or any other surname that is generally associated with jewish people  i guess kahn is a jewish surname but his name is indian and he’s a villain  and i get that vulcans are supposed to have positive jewish traits according to nemoy  and ferengis are kind of like a nazi caricature of jews   but has there ever just been an actual earth human crewman or anything else that just happens to be jewish or of jewish descent  considering how much the franchise has gone out of its way to cast the rainbow and promote inclusivity and diversity and stuff with fictional crew and captains over the years and considering how much of the actual cast and crew have been jewish it seems weird that there’s like never even been an ensign katz or chief sandler for the captain to give a throwaway order to in one episode and i get that roddenberry may have been kinda anti-semitic or whatever but he’s been dead for like 30 years  how have i watched like 25 seasons of tv produced during the berman era and like never once come across a jewish character or even a character with a jewish name  did i miss them or something do future jews not do space travel  what exactly happened in ww3,has there ever been a jewish character or jewish name in star trek
3239,startrek,for me nothing annoys me more than alien races using colloquialisms or familiarizations,what completely annoys you about the franchise
3240,startrek,they really could have used more lower ranking cast members,too bad ashley judd didnt stay on the show
3241,startrek,in season 3 episode 4 of tgn commander riker and counselor troi were sent down to deal with a proto-vulcan culture after being discovered in that episode when they were sent down by chief transporting officer o’brien in the process he altered their appearance to look like the proto-vulcans and i guess when they were beamed backed they were changed to normal can’t this be a way for people to do plastic surgery is it in this universe if not they kinda brushed over something that is pretty crazy,star trek plastic surgery
3242,startrek,i realize that it deals with forward time travel so that already is grounds for memory beta and also the federation collapsing from “the burn” doesn’t seem canon from what we’ve seen before of the federation in the 31st century from voyager and ent with the temporal stuff etc  so it doesn’t seem canon is it an alternative reality like 2009 from what i understand the latest canon to the prime universe is star trek picard also i kinda don’t want the federation to collapse so please let it not be canon,are the later seasons of dis canon
3243,startrek,i realize that it deals with forward time travel so that already is grounds for memory beta and also the federation collapsing from “the burn” doesn’t seem canon from what we’ve seen before of the federation in the 31st century from voyager and ent so it desist seem canon is it an alternative reality like 2009 i kinda don’t want the federation to collapse so please let it not be canon,are the later season of dis canon
3244,startrek,hi in canada here and after snagging the tos complete series on blu for $70 i went looking for the tng box and became saaaad amazon has two of the north american boxes for about $250 amazon also has the eu region free box - it was $146 for a hot minute but then $196 probably a cheap copy sold joyebays cheapest is $160 so okay time to look at imports ebay us doesnt have anything much cheaper nor does amazon us but wow amazon uk has it new for £57 and used for £44 that comes out to like $105 and $90-- oh cant ship to canada and it only told me when i tried to check out again sadso is there a place in canada where i can just buy the thing for slightly less than an arm and a leg no idea how much the box is meant to retail for because it seems like everywhere its sold is third parties instead of like new stock supplied by cbs/paramount any help is much appreciated,where to get the next generation complete series/full journey blu-ray box cheapish
3245,startrek,i recently got this item which is supposedly from an episode of enterprise it’s some sort of poncho/tunic worn by an extra anyone have any idea what episode it’s from or if it’s authenticprop,question about a prop
3246,startrek,i remain amused as to on an almost daily basis we see an enterprise sucks thread followed by i love enterprise thread  i know ds9 is pretty highly regarded voyager so-so but has there ever been an attempt to rank the shows based on their fan base divisivenessif i were going to rank them based on anecdotal discussions 1 enterprise2 picard3 discovery4 voyager5 tos/tas6 tng7 ds98 lower deckswhat do you think  is this about where you would rank the series in terms of divisiveness/controversy/fan debates,has anyone ever done a survey to try to figure out the most divisive star trek show
3247,startrek,is there a reason why sonequa martin-greens character has a first name that is traditionally a males name,has it ever been mention why sonequa martin-greens character has a traditionally male name
3248,startrek,die,q the miserable q the tree topper what must i do to convince you people
3249,startrek,,do we get banned for making keeping up with the cardassians jokes
3250,startrek,it easily could just be q meddling or something of the sort,they should make an episode to explain the amount of planets that are exactly the same as earth
3251,startrek,,‘star trek: discovery’ may have just found its own spoiler
3252,startrek,a couple months ago i saw a post on here about the idic epidemic book from tos i want to read it/ask for it for holidays but don’t know if there is an order i’m supposed to read them in can anyone assist,the tos books
3253,startrek,recently i started a re-watch of tng and as it seems to happen when you do i rewatch i picked something up that i hadnt before while the away team is exploring the room of the dead 20th century astronaut data is scanning the body with his tricorder whle worf and riker look around the room riker says looks like the poor devil died in his sleepas the body is lying in a bed worf mutters under his breath what a terrible way to die which i had never noticed before i love that little piece of dialogue the writers added and i have missed it on all of my other previous watch throughs this episode traditionally has not been one that i have liked too much but this little addition defintely earns a cool little plus in my books,interesting dialogue in tng season 2 episode 12 the royale
3254,startrek,outside of criticism of dsc and ent ive never really seen many people comment one way or another on the other series theme songs for me voyager has the best theme song and i love the visuals as well,voyager has the best theme song in trek
3255,startrek,,crack open a taspar egg its chanukah
3256,startrek,,how big was khans empire star trek eugenics wars
3257,startrek,,crack open a taspar egg its chanukah
3258,startrek,and everything,universal klingon solution for anything
3259,startrek,in the next season of picard i think it would be really cool if picard referenced that he lived entire additional lifetime as kamin i refuse to believe he just moved on from that thoughts,the inner light
3260,startrek,i always enjoyed star trek series since i was a kid continuing through today  some years ago i realized that star trek is sci-fi as a convenient fall-back idea for a series but it was really a show about a group of people who are faced with unusually difficult never-before-seen ethical dilemmas and how  the group and each individual is able to go against their animalistic instincts and choose a better course of action with individual moral restraint  i like this a lot about star trek  a person or society as a whole can stereotype a lot of things about trekkiesbut on the whole i dont think bad dangerous or evil nor any similar such negative adjective could ever really be believed by anyone  nobody is scared of star trek fans  theyre usually pretty ok or even really good people - even if they arent rich or powerful enough to actually be considered eccentric and are just considered weird  i like that about star trek a lot again  enterprise never held my attention though i honestly havent ever tried hard yet  discovery idk i heard it basically ruins canon and has some issues and has this alternate timeline thingim not sure the details but it breaks the rules i hear  and i *did* see the jj abrams movie - the first of the three  it wasnt a bad movie i liked it like i liked the star wars one it was indeed in a star trek-ish-in-appearance setting but i didnt like it because it didnt feel like star trek and seemed more concerned with dramatic action and adventure than holding the crew and captain to high moral standards through extremely challenging trials and ethical decisions and dilemmas   and then i just started picard  i like picard i didnt realize it was a real star trek as someone else described it to me as more of a sitcom in the star trek universe  in my opinion though its the first legitimate sequel series to the tng ds9 voy era series and is official and very good  **i thought it was ironic that the first episode was about picard getting questioned why he left starfleet and he discusses later the moral issue of the federation/starfleet turning on their promises to protect romulans - which leads to a massacre of romulans - which leads him to reply i left because it was no longer starfleet**  i feel like he is at this point in space-time making a cool one-off series that fades away **or** he is the beginning of the community of trekkies and star trek people as a whole who decide to forbid this new hollywood-esque hollow star trek stuff and bring star trek series and films back to what they do best and the way they are naturally supposed to be   should the ds9 guys do a star trek: sisko to complement along side  they could even make both of them interact but specifically exclude the new amoral actiony star trek malignant ideas which we really ought to reclassify as fan fiction someday but i degress  what do you all think,star trek: not a sci-fi per se but a vision of a highly moral human society is the new st:picard series patrick stewarts attempt to revive that quality
3261,startrek,,can we all agree that ent has the worst intro music
3262,startrek,,i really like how warm and intimate the picard theme is it’s odd that the music is so wholesome when the actual show is so gloomy edgy alcoholic and bitter
3263,startrek,,build the star trek uss enterprise- thoughts i just completed my build the delorean from them and have started my build the ecto-1 i may need to make room on my shelf for this too
3264,startrek,for starters it would make a lot more sense and would be way more believable than the mwhahahaha we evil just cos that we ended up with like imagine man in the high castle crossed with star trek,does anyone feel like a what if germany won ww2 universe would have been more interesting than the terran empire
3265,startrek,it’s the cardassian neck trick,if there’s just one thing i’m dying to see in one of the new trek series
3266,startrek,so does anyone think that tos should get a reboot with the same episodes from the 3 seasons not word for word but the same plot and information and then two seasons added on to make it a five year mission and not the kelvin timeline nothing to do with that i don’t like that thing tbh who does actually,tos reboot
3267,startrek,,the borg love them or hate them or want to join them what would you choose let us know in this poll below
3268,startrek,,star trek: discovery s39: terra firma part 1 puts georgiou center stage
3269,startrek,i was watching tng and noticed datas irises are hexagon shaped not round,something i recently noticed about datas eyes
3270,startrek,just wondering because i just re-upped yesterday the app behaving like i never paid even though i just watched st:iv yesterday i tried emailing them but even that seems to be not working,is anyone else having issues logging onto cbsaa to watch the latest episode
3271,startrek,,make it so make it so make it so
3272,startrek,is there an /r/unpopularopinion star trek sub not totally sure how unpopular this is but: i hate the mirror universe its lazy intellectually inconsistent nonsense we see it at various points in future history and at every point the same people genetically -- the same parents exist and are hanging out with all the same people so clearly all the same couplings occurred despite a different past and all the same assignments doesnt make any sense,confession: i hate the mirror universe
3273,startrek,galaxy wars by legion zoe is so entertaining and fun but please dont take our word for it - just press play and you will be on your way to the next dimension it is filled with love surprises information beauty hope suspense excitement and energy just to mention a few we all love galaxy wars by legion zoe it is very entertaining and fun for the whole family to listen to galaxy wars is a great workout and exercise song if you love to stay healthy and fit thanks for listening and please continue to take care of yourselves and each other happy holidays,galaxy wars by legion zoe
3274,startrek,is it me or both these movies have the exact same plot in both the enterprise returns to earth only to find it under deadly attack the only course of action in is to return to the past to change the future,the voyage home and first contact
3275,startrek,so knowing that the uss discovery reached 3189 within season 3 that begs the question would there still be a uss enterprise by then,so is there an enterprise by 3189
3276,startrek,,if voyager was a galaxy class
3277,startrek,i only noticed this in a recent rewatch but krall *idris elba* says he fought in the xindi and romulan wars when confronted by kirk in the yorktowns airflow system never realized he drops this bit of *enterprise* reference in there good on the writers for doing so,xindi reference in star trek: beyond
3278,startrek,i know this is a very specific question but im having a times cover puzzle made for my partner and im hoping for a star trek cover of some sort,was star trek or any of their various characters featured on the cover of the new york times
3279,startrek,travels anywhere in an instant houses a being with hundreds of thousands of years of historical knowledge and now has a will of its own sends the crew to distant planets without giving any rhyme or reasonyes the discovery has become the tardis,spoiler the uss discovery has become another famous vessel
3280,startrek,,preview: dis 3x10
3281,startrek,maybe i missed something or forgot but why didnt discovery previously jump to the nebula to see what was going on when they found out the burn originated there and that there was a ship emitting a signal  instead of trying to decode it from hq or the mission of the week why not go there to see what is sending it,discovery season 3 burn distress signal
3282,startrek,,love my surface duo padd
3283,startrek,so i just watched enterprise and it was cool series excluding that cockblocking finale now im gonna do something drastic and go all back to the 60s and see if i can watch the original wish me luck,watching star trek for the first time
3284,startrek,so did discovery ever tell the guy on the derelict station that they found star fleet headquarters or is the guy still waking up every day waiting for star fleet to contact himnow i feel bad if burnham forgot about him but that be on brand with these writers 😂,aditya sahil
3285,startrek,,why does startrek discovery stink so bad
3286,startrek,is there a reason why counsellor troi and seven of nine wear uniforms that are different from the standard issue starfleet ones,is there a reason why counsellor troi and seven of nine wear uniforms that are different from the standard issue starfleet ones
3287,startrek,given the reference in the newspaper is dsc suggesting that the guardian of forever is actually tkon  yet the being they encounter is named qarl is the spelling a red herring or does this suggest a deeper connection  could qarl be another mischievous member of the q continuum if so then are the q descendants of the tkon,is dsc hinting at the fate of the tkon
3288,startrek,i was just booted from a facebook group for reporting a post that calls for autistic fans to form a mob and take off shatners head   from what i have gathered shatners sin is supporting the wrong austism charity because they want to cure a condition that most level 1 autistics do not see as a disease i get that i support neurodiversity in every form but why do we condescend to that selfish attitude there are two other levels of autism and those tend to be the marriage-wreckers the bankruptcies and the lifetime of suffering   i have two mothers in my family/professional life with level 3 autistic sons if you have never lived with a person in this condition its a lifetime of diapers home supervision and often outbursts of madness and violence my client came to a meeting with stitches on her face from her l3a adult son throwing furniture when he couldnt find his blanket there are many people living with autism and people in the autism community who do not have the freedom of a level 1 patient--the kind of a person with a job and plenty fo time to talk about star trek shatners cardinal sin seems to be that even as a 90ish year old man he still works to raise money for families like these  moreover shatner is not a nazi a fascist a racist or even a republican hes a liberal canadian jew and an old man who doesnt want to be bullied with the latest fashion progressive language if you ask mark a altman author of the fifty year mission hell share with you detailed stories of his generosity charity and 100% non-bigoted non-nazi political skepticism in short ws is a skeptical old man - not an activist  can someone further unpack the autism angle are there missing facts the call for mob violence this morning was my breaking point i could care less about being booted from a group with 40 comments calling shatner a nazi but its reached the point where star trek fans need to stop condescending to the large community of l31s in trek seriously calling for a mob to take off his head,the campaign by autistic trek fans against william shatner is out of control largely because fans condescend to the autistic mob
3289,startrek,,are you guys aware that theres a whole star trek pop video by rhianna for beyond
3290,startrek,,it’s star trek thursday does anyone else look forward to this as your favorite day of the week
3291,startrek,given tkon references it seems to suggest that guardian of forever is actually tkon  yet the being they encounter is named qarl is the spelling a red herring or does this suggest a deeper connection  could qarl be another mischievous q-like being if so then are the q descendants of the tkon,is dsc implying the tkon evolved into the q

this also describes nero his crew and spock as they jumped from pt 2379 to kt 2233/2258 it seems kovich knows the kelvin timeline exists but nothing more than that* yor died because the temporal accords prevented the federation from sending him home this rigidity to rules and regulations at the cost of an individuals life doesnt sound anything at all like the federation we know and love but does sound exactly like the federation that allowed thad riker to needlessly die as related in nepenthe* culber calls up a medical analysis which displays in front of him the text is otherwise unremarkable but refers to georgious condition using the phrase universal constant which evokes the time travel rules not of star trek but of lost* dannus v is a new location but it is close to the gamma quadrant; i believe this is the first mention of that region in the series* worfs calisthenics program may be a descendant of the *discoverys* gymnasium which appears to include um bladed weapons* burnham gives georgiou a fitbit a technology introduced in consumer electronics expo 2013* hiraga gennai was an edo-era scientist known for*looks him up*the essay on farting* carl reads the latest edition of *the star dispatch* the newspaper which used to be a common fictional paper throughout hollywood was previously seen in the projected alternate timeline where edith keeler survived in the city on the edge of forever* on the back of the paper is a review of the soup at the twenty-first street mission which was the kitchen run by edith keeler the accompanying picture is a stock photo of a real-life depression bread line and i dont think it maps to trek* below the review is a stylized quote: let me help keeler offered this sentiment to james kirk who countered that in the future those words would be cherished even above i love you* given all these extremely subtle freeze-frame references it is worth observing that edge of forever involved the crew finding a deserted planet hosting a portal with a guardian that allowed you to step back in time* a smaller headline on the front page of the paper reads supernova threatens tkon empire the tkon empire was featured in the last outpost and were an advanced society living 600000 years ago until a supernova destroyed their homeworld the only identified remnant of the tkon was in the form of an outpost guardian called the portal asleep on a deserted planet on a completely unrelated note spock estimated the guardian of forever to be approximately one million years old* another reads starship uss jenolan reported to be missing the *jenolan* was en route to norpin colony in 2294 when it crashed into a dyson sphere there were 1467 survivors* the back page of the paper also features some ancient vulcan script accompanied by a simplified idic symbol crudely-drawn as though it were a rune* there is a crossword puzzle on the back page but it is composed of hexagons not squares i dont know what this could indicate and the pattern of the grid isnt familiar* the price of the paper is 15 quatloos the initial wager that kirk was untrainable in the gamesters of triskelion* besides all that georgious apparent time-travel journey is also reminiscent of the orb of time in wrongs darker than death or night* epsilon indi in the prime universe was an area of dispute for the triacus marauders in and the children shall lead* kepler-174d is the name of a potentially habitable exoplanet discovered in 2014 i believe this may be the first mention of a real-life exoplanet although there are several stars featured in trek that have been found to host exoplanets after the fact* mirror stamets refers to georgiou as daughter of rome explicit evidence that the terran empire may be a direct successor to what we think of as long-dead power,canon references - terra firma part 1 spoilers

3298,startrek,&gt;spoiler after the last episode im quite sure that all the info we got are false leads planted by the sphere data aithe location of that nebula came out of the discovery computer after using all the input the computer sends them to this specific far-away planet to cure georgiou where they cant easily communicate with starfleet the info about the distress signal is only revealed when they are away from starfleetthe computer creates a kelpian starfleet captain to impress saruthe kelpian woman is dressed in white just like the zora hologram in calypsoall in all the sphere data ai has unfinished business in that nebula which has nothing to do with the burnany thoughts&lt;,yet another burn theory
3299,startrek,so ive gotten hooked into discovery i thought id check out the other series started with the original immersion utterly ruined when i saw the starships of the 24th century communicate via fax ive been told deep space nine is not set on a ship but on a station so i presume its a different show since theyre not bolding going where no man has gone before   anyway which star trek series should i watch does the original get better is deep space nine still good even though theyre not on a ship is next gen a good starting point im a star trek noob,where should i start

3307,startrek,so as i have posted before i am watching a straight run-through of voyager for the first time i made it into season 7 yesterday and am watching the episode imperfections so seven asked belanna if she believes in an after life and belanna responds i hope so wasnt there a waste of time episode where you experienced a near death event and went aboard the klingon death ship of dishonor to save your mother and you say you hope so out of everyone on voyager you should know best belanna torres good thing seven didnt ask neelix with the whole big tree in the afterlife episode we werent given a clear explanation to that does he believe in an afterlife or is he all smiles on the outside but a cold lifeless hulk on the insidealso i have noticed this previously but havent mentioned this on reddit yet who is keeping the pacing for the show they go from time critical to we need 5 minutes of dialog when they shouldve been blown away by then captain the shields are at 52% bam 26% bam captain shields are down bam all of crewman schlekis belongings are lost in space again captain and we cant take another hit beam me over captain its the only way you will make it through are you sure xxxxxxx we were just getting to know you and what will we do without your cooking i am sure captain and as far as the cooking goes you have neelix and the replicators rim shot okay we will beam you over captain should i notify such-and-such that xxxxxxx is going to beam over no thats okay im wearing my plot armor see you in a bit i will walk xxxxxxx to the transporters and were taking the long way xxxxxxx do you need to pack before going over to the shipi enjoy the show but some easy corrections should have been put into a lot of these episodes thats why the mandalorian and the orville are so good made for fans by actual fans,issues with voyager s7 ep2 imperfections
3308,startrek,is there a trend here  first we have captain cristobal rios and the la sirena quickly followed by seven and her ship and now we brooke and his ship  small fast freighters with some defensive capabilities with a flat asymmetrical design that were meant to be multipurpose and all set for some adventurethere is a fictional appeal of han soloists the maverick captain with his small ship daring all the odds thrown against it  i am not sure how it fits or still fits into trek lore  i dont know if there is some corporate pressure from the top to make shows more star warsy or that more and more writers are internalizing star wars concepts and this is showing out unconsciously in their writing   the maverick and his ship certainly goes beyond star wars as we have seen from whedons firefly and the upcoming live action cowboy bebop   its almost a universal thing in space opera and a foundational trope    with the han soloist you will see the accompaniment of a wild west like this region of space we see in picard with the destitute romulan colonists with law and order held by rangers  in discovery the wild west has expanded virtually to everything else except for well defended pockets of civilization  does it contradict the internal realism of the lore   in almost every space lore we should expect to see small craft piloted by a captain and a small crew   within the realistic confines of the star trek universe we can expect such things to happen  however when relying on such devices we take a risk with the shows special identity to avoid turning it to yet another space westernsome thoughts of mine  what are your take  are you okay with soloists  do you want to see more of them,han soloing in the star trek universe

3311,startrek,in all series there are always instances where the warp core is offline or ejected but somehow the ship is still going - where does this power come from without a warp coreif there is backup power has it ever been explained whether they are smaller backup warp cores batteries or perhaps that impulse engines also generate electricity and can a ship warp without warp core power like when ejected,is warp core the only power generator or there is backup

3314,startrek,was rewatching the trilogy say what you want about the story/characters/etc the soundtrack never failed to be great  the 2009 main theme is pure trek imo the right balance between inspiring solemn and screams “call to adventure” thoughts on the soundtrack,the kelvin movies have a beautiful soundtrack
3315,startrek,i have a chem ii final an engineering final and an essay due all this weekend so this week stinksthere are probably almost 800 episodes of star trek total by now and i have watched every single one of them at least once through but many of them not in a long while and i just can’t think of which would make a good rewatch this week i just need some good old fashioned “you can do this ensign” stuff for the end of the day when i am totally burnt out and threatening to change my major for no reason anyone have any go to inspirational episodes from any of the series much appreciated,hello trek family what are some great inspirational/heartwarming episodes to watch to get me through finals week

3319,startrek,i was looking at the article for siskos creole kitchen and i checked out the menu noticed that none of the items have prices because earth is post-scarcity - nice detail,small detail i noticed while browsing memory alpha
3320,startrek,in most star trek shows when the bridge crew beams down to some backwater planet accompanied by low ranking officers the low ranking officers usually end up getting killed  tos was famous for this  with red shirts dropping like flies  lower decks is different in that when low ranking officers beam down they dont get killed as much  probably because they are main characters  if they werent they would likely be dead already  hell one of the senor officers has already been killed  he was a jerk but at least he died a hero  so i guess we wont be seeing the usual low ranking nameless officer get killed on away missions as much  but is it really star trek if the red shirts or gold shirts for the tng era arent dropping like flies  let me know in the comments,lower decks has to be the first show where low ranking officers dont get killed on away missions
3321,startrek,until two years ago i didnt know much about star trek i had seen some of the plinkett movie reviews and watched a portion of star trek iv around 2009 when i was 14 i was more of a star wars guy albeit not a big fanbut two years ago i started watching the next generation simply because i always found the show fascinating from the hilarious plinkett reviews and oh boy was it easy to get into i fell in love from episode one binged it through watching several episodes a day next i watched all the films then tos then ds9 then voyager then enterprise then the kelvin movies i even watched all the fan made episodes new voyages &amp; st continuesafter all that i can safely say that star trek has become my favorite franchise ever even though im only 25 and i just watched everything during the past 2 years watching those old shows gives me a weird sense of nostalgia it feels like i was there when the shows aired even though i wasnt the stories of the shows and movies that spans several centuries is simply epic the stories often give me a warm feeling since the vision of the future seems to positive and most episodes end with a happy endingtos is certainly my favorite show and era many say it feels campy after over 50 years but to me the series feels timeless and still relevant today i just love the 60s retro-futuristic atmosphere and the talents of shatner nimoy kelley doohan takei koenig and nichols are simply fantastic i never grow tired watching them on screen my favorite movies are wrath of khan and voyage homejust wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding star trek as it has had such a great impact on me on such a short period of time after i discovered it,been watching star trek for two years now here are my thoughts
3322,startrek,,star trek parody movie
3323,startrek,star trek had always pushed societal norms since the first us televised interfacial kiss to representation of races/gender/orientation in the modern series was this considered too far for the audiences and advertisers of that eramcom/wiki/starfleet\uniform\2350s-2370s#skant,uniform question: why was the skant unisex skirt-pants introduced in the first seasons of tng as a message of equality only to be phased out
3324,startrek,hello i started to watch star trek for the first time and i love it and had a question about a certain character and thought this place may be able to provide and answer my question is: how is khan and the other “super humans” or whatever they’re called in the original series so strong if they were bred from eugenics how is it that from a total of 47 odd years between ww2 and 1993 which only leaves a few generations they already have “50 percent more efficient breathing” and are significantly smarter and stronger than “regular” humans that just seems way to short of a time anyway that’s my question and i thank anyone who leaves with an answer or comment good day and godspeedps an llap,khan question potential spoilers involved st the og series
3325,startrek,i still somehow end up liking dukat and feeling empathy for him at certain points in the series than they hit you with an episode where you’re reminded of just how truly evil he is,even after watching ds9 for about the 10th time
3326,startrek,and why is picard the only captain to wear the velour jacket,uniform question: why was the scant unisex skirt-pants introduced in the first seasons of tng as a message of equality only to be phased out
3327,startrek,,tiger king is mirror universe steve irwin
3328,startrek,,looking at the mego picard figure now in the uk at b&amp;m stores
3329,startrek,given the enormity of the her ships is there any logical reason why bridge consoles seem to be the ones that explode during combatthere is plenty of on screen evidence of different parts of the ship being hit but the bridge consoles explodeengineering gets hit bridge consoles explodearmoury gets hit bridge consoles explodenacelle gets hit bridge  you get the pointi can kinda sorta understand that engineering itself would be the recipient of lots of second hand internal systems damage but the bridge the small room at the very top of the ship  surely its mostly computer interfaces and not a whole lot of big massive power conduitsdo consoles explode all over the ship,why do the bridge consoles explode
3330,startrek,im going to be controversial on this sub and say that tng was good why then were the tng movies so bad they had more money more time in between movies the same writers and the same cast at least the first three do not only that but they had examples of what good star trek movies looked like with the tos movies so why then do they suck so bad even if you like one or two of them i like first contact you probably agree that even the best one doesnt live up to the standard the same cast and crew set with the show i think the problem is precisely that its the same crew and writers behind the show a big problem the tng movies share is that they feel like expensive tv movies and its because they were done by tv people maybe if rick berman had given it to someone new while he focused on his tv shows we wouldve gotten what we did when harve bennett took over after rodenberry then again that wouldve given him more time to interfere in ds9 so maybe it was for the bestthat doesnt excuse everything like having an awful attempted rape scene on trois wedding night followed by this exchange picard: deanna can you describe it  troi: it was a it was a violation shinzons viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts ive become a liability i request to be relieved of my duties  picard: permission denied if you can endure more of these assaults i need you at my side now more than ever but you know at least it would explain why they arent as good as the tng ones,why are the tng movies so bad
3331,startrek,it’s always full of emotion but everyone holding back just enough for you to understand why they can be a great empire they are very politically focused i’m not so much for political drama but the acting is always fully on point and 80% of the time they do not go overboard the same can’t be said of early ferengi so i always go back and watch them #houseofmartok,i find klingon episodes a challenge but when i get to them hot damn
3332,startrek,i was thinking earlier about what kind of star trek games i’d play since we don’t get many these days one game i’d totally play and i doubt it would ever be made would be something involving ancient klingons much like ghost of tsushima ghost of qr’nos going around the planet maybe a cool story about your house fighting for power another i’d play would be something like bioshock maybe set in the mirror universe going through a stat base filled with crazy terrans would be interesting i doubt either of these would ever be made but my god i’d kill to play them,what kind of “unconventional” star trek video game would you want to play
3333,startrek,on a tng vibe again and seeing tasha’s sister again made me realise that although there may have been drama behind the scenes her dumb death was appropriate though explaining it to tasha’s family is a crazy challenge it’s not often that we see main characters die in a not dramatic way ie phasers torpedoes prophets etc it’s a reminder that on all these missions where there are casualties and they may not be for the most ‘important’ mission or they just get shot in the neck by a plant or they get experimented too hard or they get caught in a virtual mind fucknot a “today is a good day to die” death but because of the mission of discovery they made their contribution and they were valued so no not joining the navy but yeah,tasha died to show us that so many people die for ‘silly’ reasons
3334,startrek,hey guys&amp;#x200b;ill start by saying that im not a huge trekkie ive watched most of tos tng and voyager some ent and 1st season of discoveryso if this is a stupid question its due to me not being too deep in the lore in generalok with that out of the way ill elaborate on my question a bitmany races get design changes over the different seriesconsider for instance the tribbles episode from tos the crew only realizes that one character is a klingon after bones took his temperature yet in later series klingons look very different and its hard to believe that anyone would mistake a klingon for a humana similar point can be made about romulans in the neutral zone some of the crew project their hatred onto spock because romulans and vulcans look more or less the same in later series however the two species look very much distincti totally  get how much of this is due to budget and tos being a little trashy in general but how does canon cope with it are these things explained at all and if yes how so&amp;#x200b;thank you very much in advance,how does canon cope with design changes of alien races
3335,startrek,im currently on s7e1 of tng ive been watching that for the first time and i feel like starting ds9 i have seen a few episodes as re runs while channel surfing but im now gonna watch it properly  i know the basic premise which is that its set on space station deep space 9 neer a wormhole by bajor and some war i know a few of the characters  my mom was/is a big fan of ds9  so yeah what should i know going in,just about to start watching ds9 for the first timeon netflix what should i know going in no spoilers
3336,startrek,i hadnt watched voyager in quite a while 10 years at least probably even longer and am quite surprised right now how many great episodes it has in general and especially in season 6 im halfway in and hope it continues with that qualityi very much enjoyed the episode where tuvok loses his personality for a while also pathfinder was amazing and the highlight so far has been blink of an eyethe latter has easily made its way onto the list of my favourite trek episodes cant wait to see whats in store from here on out,voyager season 6 is amazing
3337,startrek,i live in rancho cucamonga california dm for more details if youre interestedmostly tos with some tng and ds9 stuff like plates models etc,3 boxes of old star trek memorabilia free to whoever can pick it up
3338,startrek,i am a big proponent of watching the original series in production order as i feel it is the best way  this means i always start with the cage  however if someone who had never seen the series before were to watch it like this wouldnt the pilot act as a spoiler for the only two-parter  i am not just talking about the vina reveal in the flashbacks i am talking about pikes fate as well  it seems to me that if you go in knowing the outcome of the cage then what mr spock is doing is clearly obvious  there is no mystery to why spock is kidnaping his old captain and stealing the ship  i am glad that cbs all access is now including the cage amongst their steaming service despite that it never aired i just wish they would have a production order option for tos i just think that it might make this episode a little redundantthe first part of the menagerie has a lot of original material but the second is mostly just a clip show like we often saw in the 1980s and 90s  it is almost like watching a commentary addition to the the cage with captain kirk providing the voice over     if you would like to read my review of part ii of the menagerie you can do so here: ,does watching the cage first spoil the menagerie
3339,startrek,im doing my first ever watch of this show and the shift in tone is sudden and weird and a really noticeable and overt reaction to 9/11like theres an out of nowhere terror attack and then the nx-01 is retrofitted to become a war ship its flying a load of troops into an unknown location to fight an unknown enemy and suddenly every single episode is **gritty as fuck** even the set lighting is suddenly at half strengthi know that all fiction even sci-fi is going to be a product of the time it was made but i dont remember the last time a show i was watching had such an immediate shift in tone and for such an obvious reason,enterprise suddenly turning into an iraq war metaphor for season 3 is definitely a /thing/ spoilers
3340,startrek,after the romulan shuttle carrying the senator was blown up thanks to garak the romulans investigated the explosion and concluded that the dominion was responsible  given the evidence as presented in the episode this makes sensehowever they really glossed over the fact that it should have been easy for the romulans to figure out that the shuttle made a stop at ds9   this visit wasnt covered up from what i saw so it should have been at least a part of the investigation  but no romulans ever even tried to contact ds9 to try to see what might have happened on the station  they just declared the war and the rest is historyit seems very unlikely the romulans to not investigate this properly   i never noticed this until the current watchthrough and now its bugging me  how do you reconcile this  is there something i missed in the dialogue,just rewatched in the pale moonlight and have a question
3341,startrek,hi im interested in the federation as a model for a future utopia and i was wondering at what age people in the federation are allowed to make decisions  autonomously from their parents also in federation law is there a specific age where people are considered adults and does this vary like  our laws or no longer make sense in their universe ,what is the age of magority in the federation 
3342,startrek,i recently did a rewatch of tmp and something really struck me:  we almost never see the alien diversity in the crew that the star trek legend is so proud of except for the main cast  the recdec scene had alien crewmembers scattered all the way through the room but that was pretty much the only timetos had spock and only spock as the only non-human crew member except for another vulcan in the mirror universe  tmp had a forehead guy on the bridge who didnt have much to do besides stand at his stationtwok brought in saavik as a featured charactertsfs moved saavik over to the grissom -- and enterprise had a tall bald guy in the background of the admiral morrow scene that guy could have been an import from relianttvh was a special case no enterprise for most of the movie but there was the alien helmsman on saratoga and the alien comm officer at san francisco hqtff had nothing  except spocktuc had that reptile guy on the excelsior bridge and the comic relief scene with crewman daxnone of the other series do much better  ds9 did have diverse aliens as extras in the promenade scenes  im wondering why they didnt show comparable levels of diversity in the background characters on other series,alien diversity on the enterprise
3343,startrek,they are talking in ten forward and mention how someone is stuck there then she asks where rikers last known position washow did she know the name,in the episode first contact 4x15 how did mirasta yale know the name of riker
3344,startrek,,rule of star trek: caves have stairs
3345,startrek,what are the current thoughts on whether a teleportation device could realistically reconstitute the actual being or only a replica of the original thing,the star trek transporter machine teleportation device began in the original series and continued throughout most all the follow up versions as it converts things into energy patterns to be beamed elsewhere reconstituted or reconverted it seems to open up questions of is it the exact thing
3346,startrek,,the enterprise intro works surprisingly well with the quantum leap theme
3347,startrek,i was not sure after first watching it if this would hold as my favourite episode of anything but it did however i was not sure why and over time after first watching it in 2013 and a couple of rewatches since and trying to work out why the result is so effective and have come to the conclusion that for me there are just many different emotions and reactions involvedi have thought about this episode for way too long and can find many different interpretations that are compatible with each other the more i think about it the more i am amazed as each of the points below are also extremely powerful on their own its as if intended to merge multiple themes into one whereas usually the episodic format limits them to 1here they are for those interested:* contentness with the knowledge that kamin eventually found peace in his relationships and managed to carry on with his memories of enterprise in the back of his mind and that he led a calm and enjoyable life as kaminthis also relates to picards backstory never had children etc which people like to highlight but i personally take a more abstract interpretation from this as it is quite a nice concept that things will eventually resolve themselves however his lack of prior family probably helped enable this* overwhelm at the point where he woke from the statehe finally discovers that all of the panic he felt at the start was genuine and he isnt mad that his memories of the enterprise are real etc and that he had to spend years fighting against people telling him otherwise: he was right all alongthroughout the episode you are left waiting for some kind of explanation to what is happening and the reveal is beautiful imo* realisation that he was the sole person to be chosen to carry forward their memorythere was uncertainty and suspicion at the beginning as to whether the probe is dangerous brain rapes picard; he feels kidnapped at first; also the government guy is suspect but as it turns out the beam nor his forced experience was never malicious in the first place and further to this it self-destructed after its mission was complete their memory does not live on anywhere elseso there was only one probe with a one-time use there is surely something special about being selected to experience these memories with picard* despair at the loss of their civilization due to the nova; all the characters you met over the last 40 minutes/years are suddenly long gone it exploded more than 1000 years agoyou experience all of kamins happy memories and are provided with a gist of the overall joy of kamins life but his family is gone in an instant and the whole planet their deaths are also greatly exacerbated by the fact it would have occurred far back into the pastso any hope the viewer might have had of picard somehow touching-base with them virtually or otherwise is hopeless and you realize that very rapidly which is pretty damn heartbreaking* even more despair at the fact they werent able to do anything about the nova but in particular that they didnt even attempt it because they knew it was so hopelessthe government supposedly lied about the rockets purpose to keep peoples hopes up it was a white lie to keep peoples happy this would have been an immensely heavy decision in itself and you feel for the leaders regardless of whether it was correctthe self-reveal of his family saying remember us towards the end makes this even more damming there was nothing they could do* peace in the knowledge that they must have all died together painlessly and instantly and they collectively knew it was comingin the self-reveal they were smiling and had accepted their fate they could be seen to be making the most of their situation even with death in sight which we recognise as an incredible achievement so it follows that we are extremely impressed but they just in an incredibly weak position so this is also heartbreaking* realisation that the same thing might happen to our solar system some day or human extinction through some other means so therefore we should be making the most of everything and kamins main quote to his daughter is this exactly for me this whole theme or the effect if unintentional is so immensely powerful that it forces me reflect on my life intense periods of good and bad events etcand then the flute at the end he is feeling sad knowing the civilization is in the past but also happy to have experienced it as kamin but also likely desperately missing kamins family - moreover though he is generally respecting their and our civilization at the same timethe above is all stating the obvious but its just stunning if the multi-layering was intentional then it is also genius this was immediately my favourite regardless of the internets hype about it which i only discovered later and is well-justified,the inner light - analysis
3348,startrek,it seems like worf is always trying to get out of taking care of his son alexander its like one excuse after another so my question is would worf be considered a bad father by modern standards  surely he would have to pay child support or something i know money doesnt exist in startrek but in 2020 he would certainly have to pay something right but even if he didnt because alexander is with his grandparents is worf still a bad father,is worf a bad father

3361,startrek,the bynars were desperate so how did they know that someone else was going to remain on the ship with riker or as it says in memory alpha:&gt;near the end of the episode minuet reveals that her purpose was to keep riker on the ship so he could access the files needed to reboot the bynars central computer she specifically says that picard staying behind was a fortunate happenstance meaning that the bynars likely had an alternate crewmember in mind for the second person as picard later points out the files required two people to access them,in episode 11001001 tng 1x15 if picard was distracted by minuet by accident and the password needed two people to type it in how did the bynras know that someone else was going to be distracted with riker

3367,startrek,i know it gets brought up a lot but i just finished enterprise for the first time and it was amazing theme song excluded but the finale was such a let down i know itll never get the extra seasons it deserved but i would love to see even just one short trek that was an older captain archer or other main cast remembering the good old days #triplives*and unrelated side note i was so certain that the mirror universe episodes would tie into terra prime episode but was disappointed thought the leader would end up being from mu or hoshi would be the spy as a crazy twist**double side note the leader of terra prime was the same actor as the bad admiral in the kelvin-verse right cool little connection now that kelvin-verse is a cannon thingsorry for the rant dont know anyone that watches star trek to discuss with,enterprise short trek
3368,startrek,in “samaritan snare” while wesley and captain picard are on their way to random starbase insert number here they’re talking and picard says something to which wesley replies “that was before the klingons joined the federation” i don’t believe we ever hear about this notion again so it’s probably just a verbal typo but wesley did say it so apparently the klingons were a member of the federation however briefly,yil that apparently the klingons are/were in the federation

3375,startrek,so growing up i was never really into startrek i was always more of a stargate or star wars man but ive decided to cave and partake in the trekie fandom nearly everyone i know says that deep space nine is the right version of star trek for my personality and content preference but i know there earlier versionsessentially what im asking is for a quick guide/tldr of the star trek universe going into ds9 i dont need you to type out an elaborate description though that would be perfect but even a few links to spoiler free descriptions of the universe would be greatly appreciatedin short i want to join the fandom but i could use some guidince from a veteren or two i know the literal badics like vulcans are longlived hardworkers with little ude for emotion but anything more than that could use your assistance thanks in advance for any possible help :,a newbie looking for assistance
3376,startrek,but i think its very appropriate because to me she seems like the glue of the crew qualifications or lack of aside she seems to be at the center of the ship crew relationships venn diagram - that is she seems to get ample time with everyone and is admired by most shes grown as a crew member and as a person over the course of a show maybe more than any other main character and why hasnt she been promoted before frankly the discoverys been through a lot of shit and i dont think anyone who was able to had time to address that i dont think that rank has anything to do with qualifications i know that a traditional military organization operates differently but in life thats not always how it works right place right time right attitude good support systems and luck can all play a part in propelling one towards a better future and i for one am glad to see someone in starfleet get recognized for their merits rather than have to work up some consequentially rigid system to find success i think that is a future we can all aspire to,i know a lot of people dont like tilly being promoted to number one
3377,startrek,i wish wed seen more of the voth in the four seasons that followed theyre one of the few adversaries that couldve justifiably shown up again and again throughout the series unlike the kazon,voyagers distant origin 3x22 remains one of my favorite episode concepts
3378,startrek,greetingsi am someone who is decidedly not a fan of the jjverse for many many reasons i wont go into as theyll just ban me ;- but one thing i always thought about the jjverse films was they nailed the casting of everyone except scotty i like simon pegg hes great in mission impossible etc etc but i just sont get him as scotty doesnt look anything like him build wise etc doesnt act like him doesnt sound like him hes just not believable to me and im wondering what the community view is,whats the consensus on simon pegg as scotty

3386,startrek,why was picard so paranoid about tomalaks intentions why wouldnt he let him cross the neutral zone he was clearly worried about the life of a pilot who simply went off course due to a malfunction i thought picard was way out of line then when they found out that there was a 2nd romulan down on the planet oh boy turns out it was just a misunderstanding tomalak was just misinformed of the size of the craft is the federation always so hostile to the glorious romulan star empire,tng 03x07 the enemy picards paranoia

3400,startrek,just rewatched this episode and while its not one of the greatest episode of ds9 its a fun story i was wondering though do you think it is even possible for an episode like this to be made anymore &amp;#x200b;specifically it has no villain the b-plot is about two friends hanging out and talking about their problems and the a-plot is basically a father son bonding experience where they sit in a single set and just talk to each other&amp;#x200b;i feel with how few episodes any given trek show gets now and the priority on bigger and bigger more dramatic stories we probably have no real chance of an episode like this one again at least not for a long time any opinions,is it even possible for an episode like explorers ds9 s3x22 to be made anymore
3401,startrek,there is simply no apparent benefit for the writersa majority of streaming platform users may want to see mostly battles and action and flashy explosions  the problem is that the market is saturated with that already with shows that have all that and do it better so why watch modern treksome people want complex storylines and immersive carefully crafted universes relatable character development these things are what made the franchise rise in popularity the problem is that again there are shows now that do that and do it better why watch modern treki talked to friends that previously had not heard of the franchise who watched some episodes of std but quit because of the above stated problems the only solution is to pick one of these directions  and execute them really well and thoroughly,modern star trek writers seem to lack understanding of the entertainment market - and how it could be fixed
3402,startrek,hilarious stuff,
3403,startrek,okay so how far is bajor from cardassia you expect me to believe that ben and jake sisco travelled to a neighboring world in 5 days in a ship powered by light sails  uhmokay if thats the case shouldnt cardassia be visible from the surface of bajor and not like a light in the sky but like the moon from earth i mean it took the apollo astronauts 3 days to get to the moon with rocket power  so 5 days with a light sail sounds fishy to me  comments are welcome but i just dont buy it,explorers ds9 s3 e22

3410,startrek,,why does mirror odo blow up with a single phaser burst yet it takes one of the founders dozens of disruptor shots to do so
3411,startrek,here are a few similarities ive found:krogan are like the klingons they both really enjoy fighting both have an honour system with regards to their societies very aggressive species even amongst each other the reapers/geth/collectors are the borg assimilating different species to make them become one of them and to fight for their collectivethe salarians are like the vulcans very logical science oriented species,similarities between species in star trek and mass effect
3412,startrek,i think this would flesh the crew out and really help build a connection with themthey showed they could do it with airiam they just killed her afterwardsand writing-wise i think it would be a good challenge that would force them to really flesh out people’s personality and relationships,i think it would be fun if discovery did half a season or even a whole season where each episode is from the perspective of a different character

3415,startrek,so in the preview clip for the next discovery episode terra firma pt 1 the fella who interrogated georgiou explains that all the weird stuff thats been going on with her lately has to do with the fact that she skipped through both reality and time when normally people only do one of those two things we get the first reference to the kelvin timeline when he explains that someone with a prior similar case to georgious came from a universe that was created when a romulan mining vessel travelled back in time given that explanation by that logic wouldnt all instances of time travel also be instances of reality travel if not why do some cases of time travel result in a new universe being made and others dont not trying to knock on discovery or anything am actually really enjoying this arc just wanted to get a clearer picture,trying to understand reality/time travel logic
3416,startrek,listen all star trek show veterans from captain kirk all the way to janeway know that the tradition behind star trek is more than one main/supportive character that way others can have screentime as solo episodes then other characters could come back and build more support to a story than just one person stealing a momentcmon veterans i know you can hear meif im wrong i understand,about the discovery uproar

3418,startrek,seriously i have some serious issues with this character she is a genocidal dictator guilt of a lot of war crimes and she doesnt show any sign of remorse and yet the other characters never had a problem with her and her attitude if we confront her development with the one of a character with a similar backstory like dukat in ds9 we can see how much waste of potential discovery did with her character because georgiou simply becomes someone who say nasty things to other characters instead to have an actual developmentfor the last thing i think that the prime georgiou seemed much more interesting than her mirror counterpart and i am sad that they killed her so soon,am i the only one who cant stand georgiou

3420,startrek,as anyone whos been watching the new season knows the discoverys redheaded cyborg-implant wearing helmsman has been getting some more attention lately i think thats a very good thing for a few reasons:1 *her personality is realistic* i know people like her - confident witty good at what they do but they dont want to admit when they need helpuntil they crack under pressure 2 *she has flaws and learns from them* i think the way she snapped at stamets in the dinner party scene was well written and was like a lot of arguments in the real world and by including a character who struggles with stress and what appears to be some ptsd star trek is shining a light on issues that dont get talked about but affect a lot of people also showing her recognize that she wasnt okay and going to talk to culber about it really encourages people watching who may be struggling with their own mental health issues to get help if they need it3 finally on the flip side of that *shes a really good pilot* her full manual control flying scene in the sanctuary was pretty darn cool i got big star wars vibes from that whole part of the episode in the best way possible as well as her cocky attitude afterwards - which was a fun contrast to the other characters weve seen on the show so far the conversation between her and ryn was nice too - how she used her own experience with stress to relate to him and get him to help her and having grudge along for the ride made the scene even betteroverall discovery needs its side characters and at least in my opinion theyre the best part of the season right now - i much prefer hearing about what the bridge crew are up to than another burnham and book episode for this reason underdeveloped characters like detmer getting attention in episodes are really helping make this series more well-rounded nice job to emily coutts for bringing this character to life during the new season - heres hoping this pattern continues and the rest of discos bridge crew get their moment in the spotlightthank you for coming to my ted talk everyone :,if you face something you can beat it heres why lt keyla detmer has become one of my favorite discovery characters

3422,startrek,im watching s7e6 of ds9 prodigal daughter and i think this episode is quite interesting for its exploration of sibling relationships most children in star trek jake sisko wesley crusher naomi wildman are only children and the only episode i can really think of that examines sibling relationships  is tngs brothers i was rewatching prodigal daughter and i was struck by how it depicts sibling relationships,prodigal daughter &amp; star trek siblings
3423,startrek,so they go to great lengths to give easter eggs and fit into st cannon and all that shit damn they are so dedicated to lore and they have set up some really good characters and interesting storylines so why the fuck does he say “g minor” and then start playing in a major key now the progression is moving from the major to the relative minor but that doesn’t make it minor in itself and the melody adira starts playing leads into the major tonic so it’s clearly major and it’s e major to c#minor anyhow not g fuck trek i’m done they treat this shit like a playground no respect for rules no respect for true trekies,something that has been bugging the shit out of me re: stamets this week sanctuary - no actual spoilers

3438,startrek,its funny and kinda embarrassing to see shatner acting feminine but everything else in the episode is just a standard story about body swap in my opinion charlie x omega glory and requiem for methuselah are better examples of much worse episodes from each season im not even sure that i even finished watching charlie x cause it was so boring and predictable omega glory and requiem for methuselah are episodes that got an interesting premise but both fell flat on the face when it comes to delivering a satisfying pay-off especially i hated that love story in requiem it doesnt make any sense and there were moments that made kirk look like a total wimp spocks brain is a dumb episode but there is nothing super outrageous about it it just an episode that i watched and didnt care that much about itso there is no way ill put intruder in my top 10 best but im not gonna put it in my top worst list either,is tos turnabout intruder really that bad i heard people saying that its the worst tos episode ever and it is kinda bad but its definitely not the worst thing that ive ever seen

3449,startrek,when picard was first zapped with by the kataan probe in inner light he woke up in a simulation of kataan he did everything he could to refuse to accept that this was his life first assuming he was on a holodeck then trying to figure out what planet he had been stranded on so that he could get back we leap forward five years and find that in all that time he hadnt let go it was only at around the five year mark that he finally decided to stop pining for his old life however real it seemed to him and become invested in the life in front of himthe captain perhaps had more compelling reasons than the rest of us to hold out that long he had a rich life filled with purpose a prestigious position with privileges adventure but more importantly he had a sense of duty and responsibility he would have felt it was his mission to try to return to the federation how long do you think it would take you to give up on your old life and start living the new one i dont think it would take me five years,the inner light how long would it take you to let go

3457,startrek,in ds9 our favorite starfleet officers travel back in time to an iconic tos episode to thwart a time traveling bag guy from altering the past the ds9 crew is  masterfully spliced into the tos episode and there are even a few limited interactions between them and the old gangi think it works well in this episode because in general the episode is frantic and there are a lot of bodies in and out of scenes and because although the stakes are high its a fairly light-hearted episode which is why i think ds9 would be the perfect setting for something like this with so many beings in and out of the rickety space dock all the time a crew from the future my might not be noticed at all except of course by quark and with so many filler episodes that have no *major* consequences i feel like theres room for a crew to pop in without being saviors of the dominion war and changing the timeline too muchwhich episode do you think would be entertaining to disco/picard era trek fans and ds9 trek fans alike,which ds9 episode do you think would be amazing for a trials and tribble-ations treatment
3458,startrek,hi everyoneive been walking through my partner through star trek for the first time ive seen a lot of it before but my partner is very new to it weve been seeing the good tos episodes which we like and i imagine well watch the tos movies soonhowever once we finish star trek iv i dont know if we should jump into tng and watch star vi when we watch unification or if we should see vi before we watch tngvi before tng obviously makes some sense because its a direct sequel to the tos movies and you wont know how it would end with the klingons seeing worf spoils that but then again thats how everyone in the 1990s saw itwhat do people think also it should go without saying that im hesitant to show my partner star trek v lol,star trek vi before or after tng
3459,startrek,hi guys: i love star trek but im not really well versed in the whole universe i watched the films when i was a kid in the 80s and they became childhood favorites i just never delved into the tv series afterwards on christmas i want to introduce my gf to the st universe as she has never seen even one of the films i guess the original cast movie order is pretty self explanatory the motion picture ii iii iv v vi but i also kinda remember that for some of the first films khan specially it was useful to have some kind of previous knowledge to fully understand themcan you please recommend which tv episodes or other materials must we watch before starting watching the whole film series as a kind of prologue i guess thanks so much,what to watch in advance to introduce a newcomer to the 80s movies
3460,startrek,if you had describe yourself as a combination of 2/3 star trek characters from any tv/movie series who would you bei think i am a mix of data tng torres voyager and tilly discoveryalso: please don’t spoil the latest episode of discovery as not everyone has watched it yet,what combo of star trek characters are you

3462,startrek,,its not the usual type of ship but hallmarks tree topper this year is amazing
3463,startrek,it seems like throughout the course of the show there have been many major events that have occured and i feel like discovery being part of most of them brings the show a bit of a fanfiction vibe pike spock starting the war ending it the red angel i dont know what are yall thoughts,a thought about discovery thats been bugging me
3464,startrek,hi peoplei was recently watching a video by certifiably ingame and i saw some b-roll of what i presume to be star trek online it shows the ship uss waltham ncc-96176-f and i think it looks amazinghowever a quick google search doesnt seem to give me any info and memory alpha / beta werent much helpdoes anyone have more info about this ship or know where i could find more info about italso if there are some wall papers i could download that would be amazing time stamp: 4:18,the uss waltham ncc-96176-f can someone help me find out more about it
3465,startrek,for christmas this year i really want to paint my mom into the star trek universe she loves it so much but i barely know anything about it could you guys help me out tell me what kind of clothes i should put her in the different races a job title she could have what weapons or devices she could hold it would be a portrait from the waist up so i really just need info about what she should look like and have i really want to make this accurate thanks :,i want to make a star trek gift for my mom but i know nothing about star trek
3466,startrek,,is discovery’s identity politics destroying trek
3467,startrek,sorry this comparison comes to my mind anytime i watch ds9 the hair the make-up and the tone of voice all seem similar to me does anyone else see this,does anyone else think weyoun sounds and looks like captain disillusion
3468,startrek,,this is the reason chandler bing forever ruined star trek for me everytime someone says duty/duties on star trek especially work i always think of this
3469,startrek,i have read horrid reviews for star trek legacy well now that its been out free for a while i have played it and i agree there have been lots of mods that make it more playable and there has been a similar thread to this but no one actually answered the guys question i have heard that some mods make it more playable what mods should i consider ill quote that again what mods should i consider other than endlessly mashing f and left click right click or should i delete this game and find a way to download starfleet command 2 free the best star trek game to date in my opinion even though its 20 years old and still the best star trek combat game to date sad really with star trek on-lines combat graphics having me say wtf is that to phasers attack graphics otherwise id be playing it,legacy steaming pile fix
3470,startrek,,im conducting a poll to see which spinoff series most trekkies would like to see put into production click the link below to vote
3471,startrek,so we all know in the tng episode hide and q s01e10 q gives riker the power of the q and by the end of the episode we are led to believe riker renounces his powers and q takes them away but i submit it is possible riker always kept the power and just hid it from that point onthis explains many of the implausible rescues and missions the enterprise will go on to have over the rest of their years as well as rikers success with the ladies further near the end of star trek: generations riker flat out tells picard that he riker plans to live forever a very unusual statement from a mortal starfleet officer even kirk knew hed die one daynow i believe it is possible riker is responsible for the burn in discovery a jaded angry riker taking revenge on the federation he feels caused the death of this son from the events of the nepenthe episode of picard end of season bad guy will be michael burnham vs will riker for the fate of the galaxy   thoughts,theory: riker is still a q
3472,startrek,i am currently rewatching ds9 and i am kind of annoyed at the premise of a time to stand are we honestly supposed to believe that the klingons *and* federation are faring this badly against the kardassians and their limited support by the dominion the kardassians have still not fully recovered from the previous war against the federation they have been dealing with the maquis they lost a major part  of their fleet in their assault on the changelings and they were being *pummeled* by the klingonsdukat even admits as much in the episodehow are 2 of  the 3 dominant powers in the alpha quadrant not able to keep up with them speaking of which where are the romulans do they just conveniently forget about the dominion threat there is no way in hell they would ignore a threat like the dominion they are supremacists after allother than that i love the episode dukat and weyoun are wonderfully dislikeable as always and i do love myself some good infiltration stories,ds9 6x01 a time to stand - rewatch

3480,startrek,i’ve been thinking about the 60th anniversary and wondering what shows we’ll have by then and what the celebrations will be  assuming it keeps going and is renewed we’ll probably on season 6/7 of discovery lower decks probably season 4/5 as it takes longer to make than live action probably a 4th or 5th season of prodigy not sure about picard if they’re planning on any more after 2  patrick stewart will be 87 by then i can’t see him wanting to do so many seasons  we’ll likely have at least 3 seasons of strange new worlds and maybe even a season or two of section 31,60th anniversary 2026
3481,startrek,in the wild west they only had shootouts every now and then  in star trek they have shootouts almost every episode  not to mention dangerous space anomalies that can rip a ship to shreds  the only remotely safe areas are planets that either have ships guarding them or a planetary defense grid  and even most of those places are really dangerous  so space is a near constant war between many different hostile aliens  its total chaos  if someone made a video showing all of the combat situations in star trek it would be a long video  and if someone made a list of all the ways to die in space it would be a very long list  so space is so dangerous that im surprised most people arent like no im not going out there its insane  the people who do travel through space are either really stupid or really brave or both  so space makes the wild west look peaceful  because its so dangerous  its pretty much the wild west on steroids with energy weapons  anyway let me know what you think in the comments,space is more dangerous then the wild west
3482,startrek,i wish we had a film about it,any origin of the borg theories
3483,startrek,this is the show diehard trekkies have been waiting forthe suspense and drama you can get from a show starring filipa georgiou and *bald evil guy* and ash tyler is through the roof these are some of the best characters written for star trek especially michelle yeoh forget the old showssection 31 encapsulates the new star trek its got gritty poor worlds its a future filled with alcohol casinos and black markets - outlaws fighting for whats theirswe really need more of that gritty gore &amp; realism we live in a bleak era and star trek needs to reflect that finally the shows are catching on *picard* already did this beautifully as an immigration allegory and turned out to be one of the best star trek shows apart from other nu-trekenough of this blue eyed idealism its time for action fast fights fast dialogue evil villains - morally grey main characters that may be genocidal but are also cool --- all of that is encapsulated in section 31its a new era of star trek deal with it or leave star trek has finally grown up its time to join the fray or get left behind,&gt;&gt;now&lt;&lt; is the time to get excited for the section 31 show

3485,startrek,,star trek: the next generation - season 6 is 31% off
3486,startrek,well with section 31 spinoff series in the future i came up with some ideas for their gadgetsif section 31 need to infiltrate some planet that have some teleport protection like discovery episode 08 i have an solution- sure the easiest way out would be to land an cloaked shuttle or ship easy- but if they would detect this- well this kind of teleport protection was similar to an wlan or radio signal scrambler right - what would pc nerds do if there are to many wlan interferences right they switch back to lan cable - so they shoot an teleport capsule from the ship or capsule to the surface linked with an thick protected teleportation lan cable of course the cable must resist or block these interferences in sort: they got teleport lift with cable solution this can be used if there is no place to land the shuttle or ship of course if they can penetrate the force fields- this is some sort of airborne rangers in star trek ops way no need to look if there are atmosphere for parachutes use also this goes way faster no need to sky jump like in kelvin timeline- send an independent capsule down that create tools for the mission from its database like weapons inspiration took out from games where do the unwieldy weapons go solution and stuff they can fail safe protect the access if it falls into enemy handsi wonder why i have these sort of ideas,my section 31 gadgets ideas
3487,startrek,,that green-blooded
3488,startrek,it was the mid 1980s beta and vhs vcrs were everywhere i opted for beta because at a time when movies were being rented by almost every business the vhs copies were always out but beta was in stock then the tapes became affordable to purchase and we all started to build our library of moviesi bought a beta copy of star trek - the motion picturei then bought another copy but on beta - hifi that had stereo soundwhen my beta vcr died i bough a vhs - hifi copythen i bought the vhs wide screen releasethen i bought the directors cut still on vhsthen i bought the 25th anniversary editionthen i bought the dvd of the moviefinally i bought the blu-rayi hear it might be released as 4kcant wait,my comedic dedication to owning st-tmp over 20 years
3489,startrek,i mean this post as a rhetorical question concerning how the show continues to structure its season arcs- in season 2 there was a whole lot of postulation about who/what the red angel was and ultimately it was burnham plenty of people speculated it could have been iconians or some extra-dimensional beings but given how closed the bubble of the plot is of course it was going to be burnham ultimately the burn will either be caused by discovery travelling through time or burnham sending the time suit back into the wormhole to self-destruct its far too easy all the theories concerning the omega particle q a super weapon etc they venture too far outside the bubble of of the plot and how the show rotates its narrative burnham is the centre of that narrative- if she isnt the cause of a problem then she is the ultimate solutionit ends up being both predictable and boring and its one of the inherent issues of presenting these large-scale mysteries in a show that largely revolves around one person if the mystery of the plot doesnt personally concern the main character its easy for the audience to get disconnected from the plot or ask the question why should the main character get involved one show that did this well was mr robot but for an entirely different reason and one that i wont discuss at length because i wouldnt want to spoil the show for those who hadnt seen it long story short the main character elliot does something that he believes is right after a lot of internal fighting about whether or not it was right to do and that many people would initially believe is right and after the thing happens he realises that there were many repercussions that were outside his control and that there were powers at play banking on his success in mr robot the plot is solely elliots story how he affects his friends and family and how he finds justice for the wrongs in his life hes always playing catch-up and attempting to out-maneouvre those who would use his actions for their own gainfortunately for mr robot it never had a big mystery to solve but rather a continuous slow burn no pun intended of elliot fighting the interests of the other players unfortunately for discovery there doesnt seem to be much of a parallel in terms of drawn out plot or story outside of burnhams centrality to the story and i get that people will be mad at this post and react strongly thats fine theres a very wild and disturbing insanity on either side of the debate as to whether or not a person likes discovery or if its a good show but i encourage everyone to think of how disconnected the episodes have generally been outside of burnhams screen time for instance what happened to the guy who sat at the same desk for 40 years why doesnt admiral vance retrofit all the other starfleet ships with the spore drive besides removing discoverys pivotal nature to the plot communication consistency within the show has made no sense with ships/worlds either able to communicate through subspace or not why would a ship from the 23rd century have plant seeds from the whole galaxy if the whole galaxy hadnt been explored then and why would it be placed near a star why didnt earth know about anything happening within their own solar systemthe reality of all these questions is that each story is just a way by which discovery fixes things after all what better way to end the season after building up so much goodwill than to have everyone discover it was the time suit that caused the burn in the first placethe producers and writers visit this sub its why theyve dived into making snw because they think itll satisfy some nostalgic craving for the good old days of episodic stories we dont want nostalgia; we want coherent intelligent stories that dont continually hinge on the same person solving the problem no more no lesstl;dr: burnham caused the burn,is anyone going to be surprised by the cause of the burn
3490,startrek,why do klingons look like space orcs,star trek discoveryspace orks
3491,startrek,i’m in season 2 episode 8 thanks y’all  i’m trying really hard to like this series but between the bizarre editing strange cinematography meaningless upside down spinning shots dutch angles for days soapy dialogue characters giving a full description of mysterious anomalies just minutes after encountering themi just need help coming down from this negativity,what’s your favorite part of discovery i’m feeling kind of lukewarm to it all so i need some help here
3492,startrek,,how many of us here shave our sideburns with a diagonal slant because well duh
3493,startrek,future imperfect is the name of the episode in season 4 episode 8 of star trek the next generation it is really good but the ending was absolutley horrible they just shoe horned in a little bitof explanation and said ok we are done now i get that the show runners are working with a lot of great story telling in such a limited time frame but this one has me all shook upthe episode is great up until the last ten minutes so i dont know whether to say it is my favorite episode or my least favorite it had such great potential i mean dont get me wrong the ending was unique and i enjoyed the idea of it but if felt so forced and quick i am genuinely conflicted lol either way this is a great show and this episode takes nothing away from it at all i am just a little confused at how i am in love with and kind of annoyed by a single episode  any thought on this episode i would love to get yalls input even if you dont share my opinion like i said it takes nothing away from this amazing show,favorite star trek episode maybe tng
3494,startrek,as of the 24th century various shows had them using naked singularities therefore they would not suffer issues from the burn as dipicted in star trek discoveryso why doesnt 32nd century starfleet power thier ships with 800+ year old romulan tech,do romulan ships use dillithium

3502,startrek,for me the most exciting thing about discovery season 3 has been that we basically have a whole new universe to play with one that could never be fully explored in just one show so i thought i’d throw a couple ideas for spin-offs out there to see what you all think1 united earth defense force - with earth having become a somewhat isolationist entity post-burn i’d love to see some of the conflicts they’ve been involved in either before or after discovery’s visit obviously a bit harder to do proper exploration but the sol system is a big place without warp drive2 generation ship - in episode 34 we learn that adira reached earth on a generation ship and i think it would be cool to see some of that journey of course seeing as adira is being pretty well fleshed out on dsc proper it might make sense to focus on the ship at a different time or a different ship altogether either way sub-light interstellar travel opens up a ton of opportunities and i can imagine the series working kinda like bsg where there’s an overall story and premise but most episodes focus on various logistical issues that pop up on a centuries long journey3 the life of a courier - this would definitely risk treading into the same territory as the mandalorian but it feels like the best way to really explore the post-burn galaxy - a lone mercenary or small crew looking for dilithium and checking out all kinds of planets and civilizationswhat are your thoughts do you like any of these ideas what would you pitch,spoiler dsc s3 era spin-offs
3503,startrek,so in the next episodes bonus scene it’s revealed that georgiou’s atoms are not happy with a dimensional shift and a jump forward in time and will try to revert to their original timeline or dimension i bet that at the end of s3 she will snap back to the 23rd century without dying probably the only way to save her life and from there take over section 31 for her spinoff series,theory: georgiou’s section 31 spinoff results from her snapping back to the 23rd century at the end of s3
3504,startrek,i dont usually like that kind of animation  i loved the clone wars and star wars rebels  but i dont like 2d animated shows that much  but the lower decks is amazing  i just watched the first season  and its the best show ive seen in a long time  except for the orville  its more classic star trek then discovery or picard  so i just think its awesome and hope it gets a second season  let me know what you think about the lower decks,the lower decks is awesome
3505,startrek,why are they all the same same salt and pepper shaggy hair same rigid jaw same making a female crew member fall in love with their dangerous selves its been awhile since i watched this one and somehow id morphed them all into one person/episode for good reason now i see,season 3 tng sorta bad guys
3506,startrek,,what was the voyager episode with the pasta fight
3507,startrek,i would say five minutes  they would probably cause a warp core breach  that would actually be a funny show  but they would get killed on the first episode  so maybe not  so how long would a ship with the most incompetent crew survive in deep space  let me know what you think the comments,how long would a ship with the most incompetent crew survive in deep space
3508,startrek,in mortal coil seven revived neelix 13 hours after death kirk was most likely revived about 12 hours + putting him in iceregardless if its nanoprobes or super blood the effect is the samealso both techniques were forgotten about in the following shows mortal coil is also a good voyager episode too,i just realized something from into darkness: people dont like including me at first that khan revived kirk but seven of nine did the same thing with neelix
3509,startrek,,should i start thestar trek series with 1968 star trek or the next generation
3510,startrek,first a disclaimer i have nothing against the borg queen as a concept i understand what she is supposed to be shes supposed to be the personification of the collective the one that is many as she put it her existence makes sense and doesnt ruin the concept of the borgin theory anyway in practiceim confused if she is the collective the manifestation of the will of the borgwhy is she shown to verbally order her drones around on occasion surely if her thoughts are their thoughts she could order them through thought alone on that subject why is she always observing other cubes on a viewscreen she sees the mind of every drone surely she should know whats going on in every borg vesselis there something im missing or is it just a massive oversight on the writers part,question about the borg queen

3514,startrek,i have just talked my father into watching ds9 because he is looking for a new series he watched tng live and my early memories born in 89 are him watching tng before work and me hating star trek  for reasons too many and long to mention i have become a fully fledged trekkietldw: voyager but watching the begining of ds9 again and seeing this scene knowing the outcome makes me so envious of him it sets the tempo and tone of the series so well and you dont even know itif i could have a blank slate memory on any tv show ds9 would defiently be the one i think im gonna enjoy my fathers experience vicariously what a treat,in the mean time i will do the job i have been ordered to do to the best of my abilitysir
3515,startrek,this cult believed that simply being a cog in a greater system with no individuality was something to be championed how can you watch star trek and think that the borg ideals are something to aspire toby the way this was talked about in the first part of the third episode in the documentary series it makes me both mad and sad that star trek was used in this way to further a toxic cult thoughts how can someone twist star trek so much that the borg are the heroes,watching the heaven’s gate documentary on hbo right now and i am blown away that they watched tng and their take away was: the borg are a great model to follow
3516,startrek,i dont remember seeing this in any of the series but it seems people would be like a multi-sensory 3d video call people who lived some distance apart would be able to experience physical contact without being in the same place this might not work at extreme distances but they have had simultaneous communications with subspace messagesthis could come in handy during a pandemic quarantine i could use one right about now to socialize and get out in an environment with no germs people cold also have sex without pregnancy or risk of stds of course pandemics stds and birth control would probably no longer be a problem in their centuries except maybe the phage for a stretch,holodecks for 3d video chat
3517,startrek,im on a re-watch of all of ds9 and this episode featured 1 of the 100 changeling infants that found odo who is also 1 of the 100 it is said that these infants were sent throughout the milky way galaxy does that mean 25 went to each quadrant or all of them went to the alpha im under the impression that changelings are near immortal as in they dont age and can live forever but could be killed by disease weapon fire or cataclysmic eventis there any eu stories about the other infants also was it a lost opportunity to not feature one in voyager,98 of the 100 changeling infants where are they ds9-s7-e14
3518,startrek,just finished watching voyager s4:e25 where seven is on the ship alone while the crew is in stasis going through a nebula seven develops hallucinations from degradation in her synaptic relays that coupled with being alone for so long the episode does a great job of making the analogy of how hallucinations occur for people with severe mental health issues  another great example of how star trek takes real world problems and puts them in a context people can understand i hope the episode helped people to have a better understanding of mental health and more sympathy for people suffering from mental illness,voyager episode about hallucinations
3519,startrek,they have no idea what a cello sounds like,minor annoyance with dsc
3520,startrek,am i the only one who has noticed that almost every admiral we have seen in star trek is crooked  if they arent crooked they are at least jerks  i guess that is the type of person who would want that kind of job  but it is annoying  they must court martial a lot of crooked admirals  the ones that get caught and who their friends wont cover for anyway  so let me know what you think about why so many admirals are crooked,why is almost every admiral crooked
3521,startrek,tng s6e25 timescape  where there is the one and only use of a runabout on tng🤣 and picard data troi and geordi the enterprise stuck in timeif they can use the transporter armbands to walk around safely on the enterprise and warbird  why not take one and put it on one of the crew on the enterprise unfreeze them and ask what the f was going on,one plot hole thats always bugged me but ive never seen discussed tngs6e25
3522,startrek,hey trek fan here i just wanted to share a link to some merch i designed for this store the collection is called space explorers you can usually find this store at a lot of cons which obviously cant happen at the moment which i know is a huge bummer i just wanted to share it with some fans in case it brings anyone some joy also the people that run it are incredibly nice thanks,some merch you might enjoy
3523,startrek,they don’t even have drones or simple “ai” probes that could be sent out in numerous occasions before risking crewmen’s health and life also it’s quite irritating that on starship with 300 ppl on board it’s usually the captain and officers that risk their lives during dumb exploratory mission on some god forsaken planets if you are not 100% sure it’s safe than just send down the probe instead of your captain and chief engineer is it really that difficult to understand,why there is so little of autonomous devices defenses and robots in star trek

3528,startrek,this is a little nitpicky for sure but quarantine has me pretty bored so i want to ask; i’m watching “indiscretion” and kasidy yates’ judgment of sisko’s “fear of commitment” comes across as extremely judgmental in light that his last wife was killed in front of him in an accident a few years ago does kasidy not know this is this something he reveals to her later,ds9 “indiscretion”- does kasidy know about sisko’s dead wife
3529,startrek,its been on my mind for a while heres two cultures that i think are similar klingon empire = feudal japanthe klingons houses have a similiar structure to the various japanese clans during the feudal period mauk-tovor seems to be similiar to seppuku which was a form of sucide that would restore honor to their clan bajorn religon = christianitynow this is my opinion i have no idea if im right or wrong but heres my reasoningthe bajorians have religous texts that are like the verses in the biblethe emissary is like jesus christ he sacrifice himself to save everyone else im not sure about what the orbs would be considered asplease dont get upset if i made a mistake id be glad to make any corrections you give me,what are some cultures in st that reflect ours

3533,startrek,i know some people might not want that but i love her character and shes so fascinating yet tragically unexplored spock being in the show means its logical to hopefully get some more amanda and help to show more of the relationship between them both when hes back to his optimum mental capacityi always disliked how it was made out that amandas humanity was a detriment or that she was never really given her own agency as a person she was just spocks mother or the ambassadors wife a novelty and curiosity on vulcan but i personally would love to get to see a bit more of her how did she cope with knowing vulcans looked down on her and her son or how her son tried to squash his human heritage for so long,i hope to see some more amanda grayson on snw

3537,startrek,why did sisko warn jake against taking a girl into the holodeck when programs like flotter existsisko and quark respond to jake going into the holodecks like theyre porn-booths when literally everyone uses the holodeck for non-sexual purposes from tng and voyager we see wesley skiing down snowy peaks with his friends in the holodeck obrien and julian playing army-men even neelix taking a little naomi into one to play kadis-kot okay those last are all bad examples but you get my point rightwhy does sisko think that jakes date is going to get the wrong idea if jake invites her to play baseball on the holodeck when shes probably got her own holodeck programs shes been running since she was a kid if it were some sort of cultural evolution where holodecks were childrens toys back in tng up until before the voyager crew got transported across the galaxy where the stresses of war began to take priority over drinking romulan ale with vikings then shouldnt it be jake warning benjamin against taking kassidy into the holodecks instead of sisko warning jake about the risque nature of the holodeckthoughts,age-rating on the holodeck

3554,startrek,*i wrote a guide for anyone who has yet to try star trek: the next generation see what you think agree disagree remember your favourite episodes*perhaps you want to watch *picard* or *star trek: discovery* but you probably should check out some of the older stuff first maybe youve always been curious about *star trek: the next generation* but thats a lot of episodes to get throughwho has the time or you watched the series when you were younger and want to go back to it but youre wary of *those* really bad episodes along the wayin any case i have a guide to help you other people have delivered their verdicts on whether each episode is worth your time i have gone a little further so much of the *next gen* is golden - or at least a well-crafted silver - but i have reduced the 7 seasons down to what i consider to be the very best episodes this list includes only **30** of the 178 episodes in the series  if each episode is 45 minutes long that means that you have less than 23 hours of *next gen* remaining even then ive suggested a few that you could skip but would be mad to do so ive also \*\*\*highlighted\*\*\* what i believe are five of the very best episodes if you only want to take a quick dip in the *star trek* pool you can be in and out in under 4 hoursthere may be some gaps in your understanding where did that character go how did that character come back but recaps are built into the dialogue of every tv series this list is about getting you the best most important bits**season 1** \- 4 episodes  **episode 1 &amp; 2 - encounter at farpoint** \- it certainly makes sense to start at the beginning and these two episodes set you up with what the crew and the ship are all about youll also see the show at the bizarre end of its sci-fi spectrum with the all-powerful entity known as q he is the most antagonising of antagonists and he just loves to play god with *the enterprise*  **episode 26 - the neutral zone** \- aaaand then skip right to the end of season 1 no really you want the abridged version here it is there are many great moments in the first season and some horrendous ones but it hasnt really made its mark yet the final episode is a step up though you get a look at the romulans a species with espionage practically built into their dna youll also get to see everyone on the crew at their best and get a real taste of how the two main officers on the crew make such a great partnership**season 2** \- 4 episodes  **episode 8 - a matter of honor** \- now that youve seen a little romulan have a whole heap of klingon the drunken-pub-fight empire riker the ships second-in-command is temporarily assigned to a klingon ship for reasons and he must embrace their violent and cut-throat lifestyle to survive he does and its *really* fun to watch  **\*\*\*****episode 9 - the measure of a man\*\*\*** \- this is my first favourite on this list why well nothing happens no phasers and fired no one throws a punch there is zero peril *it is on the other hand* entirely captivating you also get to really see one key element of the show: really good acting that elevates the source material this episode is only concerned with the question of whether or not data the ships android is alive or not the court case that ensues is a delight  **\*\*\*** **episode 16 - q who \*\*\*** \- oh man this is the other reason i love *sta*r *trek* the episode starts with the return of the reality-bending q who amuses himself at the crews expense before drawing back the astral curtain to reveal one of the in my opinion best villains/monsters in all science-fiction if you dont know the borg well i dont want to spoil too much visually they are somewhere between goofy and creepy as only tv monsters can be but in terms of villainy they tick a lot of boxes its the air of inevitable doom that does it for me  **episode 20 - the emissary** \- *next generation* likes to occasionally attempt a romantic story and it usually falls flat either the affair is sickeningly sweet or one or more of the people involved comes across like a sex-pest in this case the romance is fun to watch on one side a human-raised klingon officer desperately clinging to tradition and on the other is a half-human half-klingon with a firm belief in being true to yourself its an *angry*\-passion and its delicious the rest of the episode is also great **season 3** \- 6 episodes  **\*\*\*** **episode 10 - the defector \*\*\*** \-  *next gen* hits a confident stride in season 3 almost every episode is wonderful this one is an absolute gem intergalactic politics romulan shenanigans twist and turns high-grade acting all tremendous   **episode 13 - déjà q** \- if youre not a fan of q by now skip this one if like me you enjoy his brand of megalomania this is a truly fun time this isnt about him causing a problem though; this time its all about q his arrogance his vulnerabilities and his total lack of empathy   **episode 15 - yesterdays enterprise** \- if youve followed this guide up until now theres a bit of continuity missing for this episode a main character made a surprising and underwhelming exit in an earlier season and wibbly wobbly time allows for a reappearance nonetheless this is a superb story about trying to reset a broken timeline only to cause more cracks to appear  **episode 17 - sins of the father** \- i swear ive not put every worf episode on this list but some of the best political wrangling and tensest character moments take place in the klingon-centric episodes this one tells you more about the angry war-driven assassin-filled society than any previous instalment  **episode 23 - sarek** \- theres a lot of emotions in this one you have to see the episode to know why thats actually a very clever line um so anyway at its core this is an episode about a brilliant intelligent widely respected person who refuses to accept his senility it hits a lot of emotional points and hits them hard the acting is sensational too the scenery is comprehensibly chewed  **\*\*\*** **episode 26 - the best of both worlds part i \*\*\*** \- *this* is how you end a series again you might just watch this and the next episode and get the best image of *next gen* i will say no more about it other than to say**season 4** \- 4 episodes  **\*\*\*** **episode 1 - the best of both worlds part ii \*\*\*** **-** both these episodes rule  **episode 7 - reunion** \- if youre not a klingon fan like myself or you werent that into the romance story in *the emissary* then you could step past this if you enjoy the angry love and klingon politics youll want this episode its another episode aiming for your emotions so be warned  **episode 24 - the minds eye** \- its the *machurian candidate* in space brainwashing and murder fun fun fun  **episode 26 - redemption part i** \- even if youre only watching the episodes on this list you will by now see all the elements that make *star trek* great political intrigue and back-stabbing complex alien cultures fun twists-and-turns acting greater than a sci-fi tv series ever needs this two-parter has all those elements woven together with great skill *next generation* certainly knows**season 5** \- 5 episodes  **episode 1 - redemption part ii** \- how to get you hooked for the next season  **episode 3 - ensign ro** \- ro is a character that should have gone somewhere but the actor wanted to go somewhere else nevertheless this is a intriguing episode that proves that not everyone in starfleet is a goody-two-shoes and tackles the topic of refugee crisis in a fascinating way that stays clear of heavy handed messages  **episode 18 - cause and effect** \- every sci-fi worth its salt has a time loop episode this take on the concept is one of the best because there isnt one person reliving each day in detail instead the *whole crew* feels the creeping panic of the most intense deja vu but never fully remembers what is happening when things reset luckily this crew is super smart  **episode 23 - i borg** \- a single borg drone is disconnected from the collective and held on the *enterprise* rather than punting the thing into space which picard would happily do right from the start the crew decides to experiment all good stuff  **episode 25 - the inner light** \- you *could* skip this episode the only aspect of the *enterprise* involved in this story is picard its a standalone story you *should* absolutely watch this episode however because it is a wonderfully emotional and captivating story if youre off to watch *picard* after this *the inner light* will make the captains life story so much more compelling**season 6** \- 4 episodes  **episode 10 - chain of command part i** \- imagine watching a show for six seasons and then they changed the main character mid season youd find it hard to watch well thats actually a deliberate point of this episode the *enterprise* is needed for a special mission and a militaristic regimented officer temporarily takes over the ship and picard he and his officers go special ops for a brief spell  **episode 11 - chain of command part ii** …which leads into an episode that i will say nothing about except that this one is very hard to watch but in a very good way  **episode 14 - face of the enemy** \- troi the ships counsellor has to pretend to be a romulan ive skipped a lot of troi-centred episodes and some were *very* easy to skip but this one deserves your attention and has some of the best political chicanery so far  **episode 21 - frame of mind** \- an episode where nothing is what it seems everything is a lie where even the plot twists may/may not be make-believe just wonderful **season 7**  4 episodes  **episode 11 - parallels** \- huh if your following this list then youre watching two reality-bending episodes in a row they are widely different concepts with a focus on different crew members honestly this entire episode is worth it for a brief riker vs riker moment at the very end  **episode 12 - the pegasus** \- so much of season 7 is actually quite mediocre without a lot to add to the legacy of the series this episode is a big diamond in the rough oodles of slow-burning tension officers questioning right and wrong lies and mysteries between friends and one of the cutest moments between picard and riker youll ever see  **episode 25 &amp; 26 - all good things…** \- having taken the shorter road to the end these last two episodes may not feel as significant they certainly arent the best episodes on this list its some of the biggest and boldest sci-fi youll see but it might also leave you a bit winded what is important at least to me is that these two episodes demonstrate one of the rare times that a science fiction tv show goes out with grace some try for one last season and fall flat others are shut down before they can even say conclusion  *star trek: the next generation* brings in q to bookend the series raises the stakes to the highest degree before delivering a beautifully tender final scene that is just right**final thoughts**  i watched most of *star trek: the next generation* when i was younger and recently revisited the whole series and the movies before taking a run at *picard* reflecting on all the episodes this way really reinforces how much of this show is just so much fun the majority of episodes are full of interesting moral dilemmas political mysteries inspired science fiction and wonderful actingi did feel a bit guilty about some of the episodes culled theres a two-part story where spock shows up removing those made me feel cruel if you disagree with my choices and think that other episodes should be on this list well isnt that just further proof of how great this series is let us knowi would of course recommend you watch the whole thing if you have time or at least *most* of it maybe ill do another list of the absolutely skippable episodes you know like the one with implied ghost-human intercourse or the one where the writers tried to make a statement about apartheid and ended up being weirdly sexist or when a virus makes the crew lose all their inhibitions  **thank you for reading**written by rufus scott,how to watch star trek: the next generation in 1 day

3564,startrek,why the fuck is code of honor the episode netflix chose for the preview of tng  it’s like they’re trying to keep people from watching it  like why is that episode even still available after all the corporate censorship of “problematic” episodes that happened earlier this year   community had to remove the first dnd episode because chang is dressed like a drow elf for 30 seconds while the tng episode about a bunch of savage tribal stereotypes played exclusively by people of african descent isn’t just still up but it’s what netflix uses to promote the show and even ignoring the blatant racist overtones and weird censorship double standards that netflix has the episode sucks  it’s the worst episode of the worst season  it’s the least appealing episode to choose if you’re trying to sell the show to a new audience  whyyyyyy,of all the episodes of tng that netflix could use as a preview in the menu they choose the absolute worst episode possible

3583,startrek,it seems to me that the burn could have been caused by one of the factions in the temperal cold war  what better way to prepare the galaxy for an invasion then to destroy dilithium thus crippling or destroying ships with warp drive  but if that is the case why havent they invaded  the burn happened over a hundred years before discovery arrived in the 32nd century  or maybe it was just one of the factions that wanted revenge and used the burn to get it  so was the burn caused by time travel  either way this timeline is insane and they should use time travel to change it,was the burn caused by time travel
3584,startrek,hi so i feel in std the crew of discovery do not carry themselves in proper decorum unlike the current captain and every other crew im pretty sure picard and definitely janeway would have something to say with their on the job conduct even on the other side of the galaxy voyager was more layed back but they still carried themselves well,star fleet officer conduct/decorum
3585,startrek,before you get triggered i am not a right winger not that there is anything wrong with that but i am not i live in la i am liberal more classic liberal but not a conservative i loved star trek for its diversity since the first episode of tng i was still a kid then and didnt understand many things i understand many more things these days but one thing i will never understand is forced equality i was born in ussr i know what equality of opportunity is vs equality of outcome you cant force equality to appease people and thats what discovery has done ive suffered through this terrible series because i love star trek and now i am just catching up with seasons 3 i dont like watching 1 episode at a time so i am watching the first 8 not sure how many were shot for season 3 besides the simple fact that there are no white males anywhere to be seen besides the fact that all the positions of power are help by women besides the horrible writing this is not star trek dont get me this bs about previous st was about diversity i know what st was is and is not and this is not st its garbage look at ds9 or voyager i never even thought about it because it was given that those places are going to be diverse discovery doesnt let me forget that white men are bad and don’t belong here google straight white men incompetent discovery you want to get triggered call me names or bring your sorry excuses for why i am wrong totally fine but i am right and ive realized how many people men women etc all feel the same this is not even close to being star trek funny enough orville is more st than this sorry iteration of star trek how dare they pervert star trek the only thing is shares with star trek is the name and certain references we get it patriarchy white men bad but you are not going to win anyone over and this franchise cannot survive by calling out people who made it what it is how disgusting and sad for st and gene i am glad he is not around to see what became of it,discovery omg wtf happened

3587,startrek,id rather pay the equivalent of multiple months subscription costs upfront to get a full season of serialized trek shows to binge on release rather than having to endure the annoying forced anticipation of an antiquated broadcast business model like weekly releases it honestly feels like its forcing them to write discovery as if it were syndicated tv in which half of the episode is expositionary dialogue as if theyre writing in case you didnt remember what happened last week or you just dropped in from channel surfing,an alternative to a weekly release schedule
3588,startrek,you would think they would have figured out a method of propulsion that would be faster  the borg could travel across the galaxy in minutes with transwarp conduits  and there were other aliens with faster ftl drives  so you would think they would figure out something faster then warp drive by then  so why havent they,why are they still using warp drive by the 32nd century
3589,startrek,throughout the newer shows star trek is toying with its legacy characters half the tng crew show up in picard seven and janeway are back weve got the titan pikes leading a series etcso why not have a where are they now sort of show it would need to be animated as these actors have all aged or passed on or in some cases are too expensive but imagine 10/13 episodes to do an x years later sequel series you could do this with the following:enterprise: show the final days of the romulan war and the birth of the federationtos: after tas finish the fifth year of this crews voyage and have them return hometmp/tff: theres big time jumps for the movies and there are unseen adventures following the motion picture and in the gap before the undiscovered country definitely a possibilitytng: show us a prequel series for picard and his rise through the starfleet ranks ds9: none of the ds9 crew have been touched sine nemesis so its clear to me theres a plan for them even though certain cast members are now gone animation would be an honourable way to carry on their legaciesvoy: how does this crew settle back into alpha quadrant life what happens to voyager when janeway leaves what breaks up chakotay and seven and drives her away does kim ever get a promotionkelvin timeline: the expensive cast was the reason this was cancelled so new voice actors and a slashed animated budget would solve both those problems and provide a litmus test into whether this universe is worth keeping aroundas this would be a set of anthology series it sets these shows up and reinvigorates the characters for potential future use there are stories here that dont warrant a full 7 year run but could still deserve a 1 season continuation,star trek: legacies my pitch for a show

3603,startrek,i have been trying to watch tng so far im only 10 episodes into season one and its a real drag it sucks so hard this is made even worse by the fact that every episode is 45 minutes long with awfully slow pacing and thin uninteresting plots then i look and see that ive got 15 episodes left in season one and then 22 in season 2 which ive heard isnt much better so my question is this could i skip to season 3 and then watch season 1 and 2 at the end as a sort of flashback like the machete order with star wars without it really affecting the overall impact of the show or is it really that important to trudge through the shit at the startive heard people say to just stick it out but i dont have that much time in my day for tv and i fear that if i try to stick it out i will probably just give up all togetherany thoughts on this would be much appreciated,a question about watching star trek: the next generation
3604,startrek,how is the romulan language structured i have heard it’s similar to latin to a degree but are there any good sources online that go deeper into the language,romulan language
3605,startrek,i know the chances are slim but i would love to see a miniseries that could wrap up enterprise better than what we got since the finale was really a holographic history lesson a miniseries wouldnt have to stick to the cannon of the finale small details get lost in time trips story could have had a better ending  i doubt it would happen but what if,mini series to wrap up and give a better ending to enterprise
3606,startrek,i understand that for tv aesthetics we all love a sexy aerodynamic shape like a fighter jet but as a long time fan is there any reason ships aren’t - ya know like the borg cube i’m asking if there is any actual star trek canon or technical basis for this,serious question about the shape of starships
3607,startrek,between the political intrigue in the romulan empire and picard becoming a full on badass this movie had it all first off ditching the prime directive which had always unnecessarily held back the enterprise and its crew we get an actual proper survey mission planetside in an appropriate vehicle for the job dune buggy of course and when a group of hostiles in the argo scene fire at them they do the right thing and actually fire back and dont take shit from some aggressive assholes this followed by the introduction of shinzon and the awesome scimitar followed by picard always being a bit more diplomatic than aggressive try and talk some sense into the man but instead we get a full half hour of combat that only some parts of ds9 might match up to and including just full on ramming the ee in a move of desperation and to top it off we get picard finally just flat out impaling shinzon with an iron rod and data going out in a blaze of glory this was not only a great way to end the tng arc but by far the best st movie in general perhaps some moments in enterprise top it but enterprise unfortunately really wasnt star trek it really was the extended sixth season of quantum leap and a fairly decent way to end that show as well,baseless arguments aside nemesis was by far the best movie

3609,startrek,one of the elements of the star trek universe has always been that small things can make big differences but i feel like discovery has doubled-down on this notion by explicitly showing small particles suspended and distributed through the air whether its fungal spores the weird bluish particles on pahvo the klingon cloaking device or actual grains of dust the visual effect has been used over and over again in the serieswhen i first started watching the show in mid-2019 it was one of the first things that jumped out at me but i havent seen any discussion whatsoever about why the creative team is focusing so much on that particular visual--or about what it might mean for the series moving forward,dust-like materials in star trek discovery

3613,startrek,and i’d like to say up front that i don’t go out of my way to find fault with any of the shows i’m generally content to kick back and enjoy the story and apologies if this was talked about earlieradira’s pronoun scene ok sure that’s appropriate and relevant in 2020 so no problem there is a scene at the end of the episode though with hugh paul and adira that felt awfully contrived it’s as though there was this deliberate attempt to cram as many they’s and their’s into the dialogue as possible it wasn’t necessary it didn’t add to the story it was just a ham-fisted way of overstating the point i like that the writers are carrying on the tradition of making progressive social statements through trek they could learn a few lessons from tos and ds9 first interracial and same sex kiss right these scenes themselves made the point; they didn’t need any additional dialogue to sell the idea,a tiny gripe about the last discovery ep

3638,startrek,star trek’s speculated economy has piqued people’s interests for decades one thing is certain: money does not exist in the federationthere are many ways justifications for this but let’s end one right here it is not a post-scarcity society yes replicators exist in star trek but they only existed in next generation and not in the original series the original series only had protein synthesizers so the moneyless society of the federation existed before replicators were invented also some things can’t be replicated: dilithium which is a power source for warp-drives and ugh latinumso the federation’s economy gets along fine without money or endless resources additionally we are shown that people on earth can seemingly own vast tracts of land like picard’s brother with his french vineyardseveral economic systems can manage this:1	⁠an advanced version of the commons i’m not an expert on this where people can just pick up and own whatever they have this may be the reason there are several colonies on other planets: lack of space on earth made them find new places to live a single dude could own his own planet2	⁠cooperation and negotiation: there are many names for this but essentially the distribution of resources is negotiated by individuals it’s never shown but perhaps kirk picard and mccoy all debate on who gets what room at the federation hotel kaiser-5 instead of it going to the person with the most money i’d imagine it could get very bureaucratic such as needing to write a letter to the city council if you want to get a 2-acre beet farm,star trek’s economy isn’t that complicated or mysterious
3639,startrek,to be fair i think the producers of discovery were very wise to dovetail in active links to stos and to morph discovery way into the future to avoid canon issues we are about to watch discovery season 3 episode 8 the show is enjoyable and worthy of watching but does it invoke the same sense of caring about the characters at any of the past st series i dont think so ive tried to care about this woman that out of the blue is spocks adopted sister that the entire series orbits about really i have maybe too hard but im sinceremy level of caring about any of the players in discovery is less than it is for any of the new characters that by season 3 i found myself relating to in any of the previous series im watching it because it is star trek but im not finding myself drawn in at times i feel like im watching one of the transformers movies where the action is so non-stop your eyes sort of blur and you zone outsurely someone out there feels the same way im not disrespecting the series im just saying from a buy-in standpoint is the lessor of any that preceded iti have high hopes for st: strange new worlds seeing captain pike walk onto the updated enterprise was the most emotion ive felt across all three seasonsthoughts,st:discovery - too muchtoo fastfinding it difficult to care about characters
3640,startrek,having recently embarked on the st: tng leg of my enterprise through voyager star trek marathon i am currently on season 2 which i’ve read often as being a “bad” season of the show 2/3 of the way through right before q who i’m not seeing what’s so badsure it’s not the show at it’s peak but i’ve liked all the episodes it doesn’t have any real dog episodes it introduces us to guinan dr pulaski is underrated especially if you remember the actress from tos picard continues his evolution from awkward to a true contender for best trek captain geordi becomes chief engineer riker gets the beard wesley evolves himself and we even get 1980s teri hatcher as an incredibly fast moving transporter operator in episode 4i’d say season 2 is an improvement on season 1 and is an important stepping stone to becoming the sci-fi classic it became your thoughts,i don’t get the hate for st:tng season 2

3657,startrek,i have seen the first season or two of tos the jj abrams movies and i’m now about to start season 4 of tng so my star trek knowledge is pretty limited and if this has already been answered in one of the episodes i’ve seen then i’m sorry to say i missed it i just don’t understand why a ship would beam their most important officers into potentially dangerous situations i just finished an episode where data dr crusher riker and laforge beamed over to a shipwreck on a planet and as soon as they got there data did a scan and said something along the lines of “no dangerous levels of radiation detected” really we know that it’s not dangerous only after we send over our chief medical officer our head of engineering and our second in command it just makes more sense that they would have a dedicated team for something like that,why doesn’t the enterprise have a dedicated away team

3668,startrek,ive always liked stamets for being a sassy bitch and even in season 1 i was like finally we have gay characters in star trek no maybes no mirror universe just gay and happythenlots of tragic gays shit happened then culbers death i was very unhappy with the situation in season 2 especially when even after we got culber back from the dead it seemed like their relation was toast it felt like a have your cake and eat it too situation where they were trying to have gay people and avoid any of that pesky being gay on screenffwd to season 3 and theyre a happy couple again seems sudden but whatever the less they drag it out the better they act like a real couple and fight/kiss on screen and while its a bit weird for non-binary to even be a thing anyone is nervous about in the 3200s its nice that stamets got to be the one having that talk and he was perfect in it and his little smirk in that scene my godanyway i love my space gays and it seems discovery has learned to not fuck with them anymore and just let them be part of the crew properly screw rick berman by the way or we could have quite possibly had this conversation over ds9 garak and bashir watch the early seasons its so obvious,stamets/culber in s3 is perfect so far
3669,startrek,its common knowledge of the tendency for trek shows to have a rocky first season a better but mixed second season and then a good third season and mostly smooth sailing from then tng is a prime example but it also applies to voyager ds9 and enterprise the only ones exempt from this rule are tos which had only 3 seasons and seemed like a rollercoaster of quality up and down until a lesser s3 and tas which basically has 1 season but its split 16/6 across both seasons weirdlyanyway the term growing the beard is obviously a reference to how riker grew a beard for season 2 of tng which coincidently resulted in a better season for tng and i think discovery has grown its beardthe first season was mixed to say the least i hold to my heart that magic to make the sanest man go mad is one of the great time travel episodes in the franchise and the characters are mostly all charming and likeable but their journey is more of a slow walk through mud we spend half of it in the mirror universe part of it is all about burnhams disobedience and then the rest is sort of just filler between those two beats and the enterprise arrival at the end seems to be a begging to entice the show to be renewed if it wasnt already bts just like the best of both worlds before it but instead of pulling this card after 3 seasons theyre pulling it right out of the gate the second season is a major shift though we get the show being embedded into the star trek universe more familiar faces and places show up and pike literally kicks the crew into being well a crew we get discussions of faith like new eden classical throwbacks like if memory serves and a season wide mystery about the red angels it still hangs onto some of the weaker elements of the first season like tyler and the klingons but the new stuff is more than enticingthen the third season had a lot to prove was this raise in quality a product of bringing in these legacy characters like pike or better quality on the show and it seems to be the latter now i thought the first episode was a disappointment it seemed like it was the zany michael from the first season all over again throw in a few action scenes and thats it but starting with the second episode we get that volta with the time jump we see the emotional effects of their journey we get resolution to story arcs 30 years in the making they develop these characters further in both their weakness and their strengths they have a mission they have a mystery and god damn you know theyre gonna solve it every episode except the first has been a rollercoaster for me and saru man finally he gets his long-overdue promotion and he is already surpassed numerous other main cast captains sure its his first days of captaincy but he accepts the role in full swing and is more than competent he is not afraid to sanction his officers but hes not going to ignore their personal lives like picard either he is driven by protecting and discovering but hes not going to break every rule in the book to get to that point like a few captains weve known its clear now why the show is renewed for season 4 and filming and now we can get a better picture of why cbs want this baby to run the whole 7 seasons if you want to move the franchise forward it helps to have the show move forward in time like literally all the other series apart from ent before it which arguably was such a step back in time that trek lost its footing and fell over now in the future they can write their own future without being bound by tos edging closer and closer and i hope to see this show ride on as it is now,star trek discovery has finally grown its beard

3673,startrek,i really tried with discovery twice now the leap forward fixed the glaring issue with plot that i hated though i would live to see what theyll do with klingon aesthetics in this future lmaothe other problem that still hasnt been resolved are the characters burnham remains completely unlikable but in different ways now shes so fucking selfish its absolutely painful to watch she truly believes shes the centre of the universe the rest of the characters are simple and not fleshed out and when they have character development it happens so quickly as to seen irrational and like a total 180 its poorly written moreover the overall direction and premise as been a rapprochement to star wars style which sickens me lower decks is the only of the new shows that has so far been meritable imo picard was buoyed by returns from favorites and good acting but suffers the same problems with storyline and ridiculous non relatable or approachable characters thats not what trek is about,i have tried really hard but i still cant like discovery

3679,startrek,hard to believe they ever actually get anything done if youre always looking over your shoulder for the next knife in your back even something as basic as teamwork would breakdown pretty quickly,how does the terran empire get anything done with so much infighting
3680,startrek,i am very bothered by the fact that they had adira come out in the sanctuary std season 3 episode8 and that it all happened in an akward manner in which the characters had to explain themselves rather than it being assumed as status quo it goes against everything that star trek is supposed to be like most of kurtzman trek  the people writing these shows still havent understood that the ideological conquests of trek are all about building gramscian cultural hegemony on screen ie showing a future in which social conquests are the status quo and then debating the social issues du jour via the others alien races these writers in their attempt to dangle their progressivism in front of viewers faces are cheapening the very same message they purport to defend,this latest episode of discovery undermines all of star treks progressivism

3686,startrek,just thought about how many things would be different if voyager had taken place on a larger starship perhaps there would be more crew left to assist maybe there would be more materials on-board to aid their endeavor just wondering how things would be different,in your opinion how would voyager be different if voyager was a galaxy class star ship
3687,startrek,the new episode has premiered on netflix so ive checked the translations in languages i know unfortunately the translations of adiras coming out as non-binary are mostly less than stellarin polish adira says something like nigdy nie identyfikowałam się jako kobieta więc wolę oni i never identified as a woman and so i prefer they as in the polish plural pronoun which btw is also gendered but in polish changing just the pronoun or even just the third person verbs to agree with the pronoun like they do in the later scene using plurals is not enough while some polish non-binary people use the plural although its mostly a calque from english they also need to do it in the first person especially in the past tense since otherwise verbs like identified are also gendered heres an overview of how it works in polish: in latin american spanish its even worse its nunca me he sentido como una persona entonces prefiero ellos which means i never identified as one person so i prefer they the translator completely misunderstood it probably based on their trill memories and thought that they here refers to them feeling as a plural entity instead of just one personout of the languages ive checked only the translator to spain spanish actually used non-binary pronouns used by spanish people elle instead of at best using a calque of they as a plural form that isnt actually used much in a given language,adira – disappointing translations
3688,startrek,as an atheist irl id like to scoff at the prophets and those who truly believe in them however siskos evolving relationship with them makes me want to believe  when kai winn finally sees them in season 7 she makes me believe in them even more the true faith shown by kira throughout her life is awe inspiring and then in the end i feel like they are all knowing and really screwed up at the same time faith is so subjective yet so extremely intriguing,the prophets in ds9 how believable are they

3693,startrek,michael says that book and his brother are both empaths and weve seen book talk to plants and animals before but by appearances the people of his planet are human and no one in the show has ever referred to his species as anything differentor maybe theyre some sort of human hybrid or offshoot it is cannon that humans sometimes have the ability for esp,are the kwejian human

3696,startrek,rewatching this episode and this battle never stops amazing me this was made in what 1997 the cgi isn’t perfect but it sure tops the copy and paste ships from picard and the weird over dependence in shuttles and random ships we’ve never seen before now that paramount and cbs are back under one roof is there any reason they can’t use these models mike okuda has mentioned that he’s offered the templates for his ships on many occasions via twitterbut seriously those galaxy ships taking out the galoris there any reason we can’t get that now,the battle in “sacrifice of angels”
3697,startrek,i’m rewatching the tng/ds9/voy episodes in air date order i’m now watching “the chase” and after all the times i’ve watched this episode and i’m old enough to have watched it when it first aired i still love this episode-	norman lloyd: i mean to see him with patrick stewart is such a treat-	john cothran jr: such a fun-spirited klingon his scenes with data are tng comedy done well not something done that often-	linda thorson: perhaps it’s a recipe for biscuits seeing cardassians in tng interwoven with ds9 really helps cement ds9 as part of the star trek universe and of course it is but it’s nice to see them this way-	“perhaps…one day”: the whole story of humanoids dna carrying a message for eons is such classic star trek crisscrossing the galaxy battling cardassians and romulans while trying to piece together a puzzle as old as life itself while maintaining humor throughout is everything st v wanted to be…but wasn’tand permit an older fan to wax nostalgic back in the before the internet was really a thing days there was a fan theory of “the providers” which i can’t remember if they were associated with the triskelions or not…it’s been a while but the fan theory was that they were the first humanoid life and they scattered their seed across the galaxy and many of the humanoid life we see in the 23rd century tos days were from them that explained why so many aliens looked roughly human-like i mean costume and makeup budgets and technology being what it was in the 60s and 70sso to see salome jens as this first of the humanoid life felt like a fan theory confirmed back in 1993also salome jens also made my watch of ds9 confusing ds9 premiered as i was graduating college and i wasn’t able to give it the same viewing on tv as i had tng recognizing her as the changling as well as the proto-humanoid life i went many many years thinking that changlings were the proto-humanoids it wasn’t until i finally watched ds9 the first time that i recognized that seriously bad misread,the chase tng 6x20…such a great episode
3698,startrek,i am currently rewatching ds9 and i realised that dukat was right : the bajorans are really arrogant,bajor
3699,startrek,in tng chief obrien was a somewhat polished polite reliable solid and matter of fact officer who was just sort of cool and got it i guess we start to see hints of what miles would become later in the series we see his temper in datas day under very understandable circumstances when his fiancee keiko calls off their wedding we see his temper again under an alien influence in a later episode and we see him get just a little short with a cardassian one time but we really dont see the cranky curmudgeonly chief obrien until deep space nine when he goes basically all rough around the edges blue collar working stiff with a perpetual temper is it character development did he grow into this or are we just seeing that side of him more on deep space nine since his character gets more focus is it the stress and fatigue of his added responsibilities as a father and chief engineer,what happened to chief obrien between series

3701,startrek,so i was doing a blood test today and as the nurse was shaking the vial with my blood i couldnt help but wonder if i am being tested for a changelingdisclaimer: i am in the process of watching ds9 for the first time,it made me wonder :
3702,startrek,i was always troubled by guinan’s conversation with riker in the ready room following picard’s abduction and assimilation in *the best of both worlds: part ii* season 4 episode 1it was an excellent and persuasive argument that riker needed to receive in order to proceed in the manner that was necessary: a ship can only have one captain we must all let go of picard and you can trust me on that because our relationship goes beyond friendship and family — and you know itguinan’s “motivational” argument was borne from a pessimistic and defeatist stance which is so uncharacteristic of this world and it never sat right with me even consider that guinan’s people were nearly wiped out by the borgi posit that guinan was only able to make this painful argument to riker because she held the knowledge that the events of *time’s arrow part i* season 5 episode 26 and *time’s arrow part ii* season 6 episode 1 had not yet occurred,hypothesis: guinan knew that she could safely and convincingly counsel commander riker to abandon picard when he was assimilated by the borg because she knew the events of time’s arrow had not yet taken place
3703,startrek,,ready room next week clip has major georgiou spoilers
3704,startrek,i recently rewatched generations and thought to myself what if  the ending could lead to a comedy spinoff series  imagine if you will kirk survives the battle with soran and meets up with scotty in the norpin colony and hilarity ensues when the two old geezers get into various hijinks much to the chagrin of the admin of the retirement community,what if

3712,startrek,,not trek i know but thought i would share
3713,startrek,its a great song,anybody else find themselves humming defying gravity during that episode
3714,startrek,,did we miss this easter egg for a new race reveal all along transmitting the earworm
3715,startrek,i know that rodenberry was influenced by forbidden planet and you can see it in the early episodes of star trek but there is this line from fp that i can remember kirk saying to someone but cant remember what episode it was &amp;#x200b;,forbidden planet and trek
3716,startrek,i put this as an answer to a question in another post and i also put it in the discovery group but feel it should be spread to the masses and therefore put here my fave star trek shows are in order:disco tng voy tos ent ds9 picard i thought picard was terrible - almost gave up halfway through the season - forced myself to finish it - got better but still overall weak - story arc was not interesting - acting was forced - sets looked cheap - production value just seemed very b movie ishdiscovery one the other hand for me is the total opposite - everything i’ve ever wanted in a star trek show - it delivers on depth in characters versatility in the story literally going places noones has been before each season has had great leads and supporting cast michael burnam is fantastic - headstrong dynamic emotional leads from the front real nice the way they have centred the show on someone who isn’t the captain - love the bravery - most importantly i love the actual sci fi in the show - the multiverse the spore drive the tech in the 32nd century i love how they explored spocks youth georgiou should get an award for best supporting actress - another great addition to the best sci fi show on tv since  i actually can’t think of a better one it’s only rival is the expanse and the last season of that was terrible,discovery is the best star trek show - michael is the best star trek character why the hate change my mind :
3717,startrek,some brief thoughts on adira’s character from discovery 3x8 “sanctuary” mild spoilers below the title is tongue-in-cheek but i couldn’t resist&gt;i’m really glad to finally see a non-binary character and i really like their portrayal overall especially in episode 3x4 “forget me not” which is one of my favorite of the series and perhaps of star trek generally how they handled them coming out to stamets however feels a bit anachronistic in the sense of being out of *the crew’s* time not out of our own time it wasn’t necessary to have a big coming out scene and then a later scene where stamets and hugh use their pronouns about 15 times in the course of a few sentences just to drive it home i get the significance and i get that star trek has always been a way to tell stories about contemporary humanity but when it comes to matters of race gender and sexuality it’s generally done so best when it’s shown what a more inclusive world looks like rather than projecting our current inadequacies into the future adira should just be a non-binary character like stamets and hugh are gay uhura is a black woman etc and everyone should know and we should periodically see how that affects them etc but it shouldn’t be a big dealin an episode of the babysitter’s club earlier this year there was a transgender character and it *was* a big deal to her and there was a scene in which someone had to be dressed-down for not referring to her properly that was appropriate because it took place in the 21st century i’d hope by the 32nd century we’d be well past the need for that&lt;,battle of the non-binary star
3718,startrek,or at the very least not hated it ive seen the start of all the second-gen series and i havent hated any of those seasons at a whole ds9 was mostly mostly unremarkable with not a lot of episodes i remember from a year on nothing super bad just unmemorable tng and voy had a bunch of interesting episodes that held up well and ent had a bunch of good action episodes a bunch of those episodes are even some of my favorites you could argue theyre not as good overall as later seasons but i dont see most of them as outright bad,has anyone else liked a series right out of the gate besides tos
3719,startrek,,rip star trek
3720,startrek,to get it out of the way i dont wanna see this at all nobody does huge nope but for the sake of the question if for some reason they do and its completely unavoidable the best we could hope is that theyd get it rightso who should they cast,if by for some reason they were to bring kirk and his crew into the modern trek requiring a complete recast who would you cast
3721,startrek,how is it that an hour ago i didnt know you had a brother the writers are just trolling us now arent they,well at least michael knows how it feels
3722,startrek,whats the warp speeds at which ships can travel michael mentions it takes 3 weeks at full warp to get to books planetalso whats the deal with dilithiim during the burn all the ships that had their warp cores active exploded but now it can be used again can someone explai thisthanks,question : dis warp seeds / dilithium
3723,startrek,are there any good star trek books which star or heavily feature characters who live in the federation but are not in starfleet,book recommendations
3724,startrek,first bi-racial kiss multiracial cast hinted heavily at vietnam war showed positive future in the midst of cold war all in the 1960s star trek has always been socially unacceptable i think a lot of people forget that some how i see a lot of people saying that star trek never forced things and i always seem to wonder if they actually watched any of the shows a hallmark of star trek was always pushing social norms,if you read the youtube comments its like people actually never watched star trek

3728,startrek,im drunk rewatching ds9 and just felt this needs to be addressedstay as many days as you have to even a week if necessary vedek winn - s2e2 ds9,someone really needs to punch winn in the face
3729,startrek,i feel like star trek is very age specific in the sense that the life lessons ive learned from tngs tapestry as a 23yr old is very different from the lessons a 43yr old would get from it none of my irl friends are into trek any younger adults wanna do a rewatch of the meaty life lessons with me a chat about them,any young trekkers/trekkies 20-25 wanna start a rewatch chat/ group
3730,startrek,in generations if the exit and therefore the floor of the holodeck was on the deck of the old sailing ship when picard left then how could woft and beverly have fallen down into the ocean  can part of the holodeck floor disappear depending on the program  same question regarding wesley falling in the water in the pilot and im sure other examples lol,falling below the deck on the holodeck
3731,startrek,i dont know that its exactly a spoiler but it was mentioned before that discovery has enough dilithium to control a system or two are they keeping it stored on the discovery i havent heard much more about their stockpile,what has happened to discoveries dilithium store
3732,startrek,so something you should know about me is i love huge vast fictional worlds lord of the rings harry potter and star wars especially i can recite almost every sw movie word for word i’ve read all of the legends comics and i know all you can about the expanded universe but one fictional work fictional universe was always missing star trek i never really got into it but after my dad convinced me to watch the original series i really love it and it seems to go way beyond that old show i wanted to see if you guys could help me out which series do you think is the most lore-packed should i watch next gen or pick up with something more recent thanks and i hope i can say i’m a well-seasoned fan soon :,i want to be a trekkie but where do i start
3733,startrek,i played this game as a kid on my dads pc you choose a ship theyre all the same except the names and fly it around by entering a heading and a distance and fight klingons and romulans and refuel at starbasesso i go to look up the game and its described as having krellans and zaldrons instead of klingons and romulans now the romulan ships were represented by the letter z but im curious as to why there are two versions of the game did someone create the star trek themed game as a prototype then when they went to sell it they changed the names for copyright reasons but then why the z for romulans did my dad have a hacked copy of the game with the star trek references inserted does anyone else remember this game even having star trek stuff in it,anyone remember star fleet i a star trek fan game that might not have even been a star trek game
3734,startrek,,i think tpols vocal fry is the second worst part of enterprise after the intro music
3735,startrek,the concept of the burn is cool but i have a question about how the story is actually playing out and how the story fixates on itwhy do they seem so hung up on finding the source of the burn they cant change it unless they time travel \*again\* knowing the source isnt going to bring back dilithium sure it would be nice to know what happened but they seem to act like life cant possibly go on until they find out the source of the burn and i dont really understand why what am i missing why does it matter they have all this cool future stuff and they are fixated on the past why,question about the burn
3736,startrek,i’ve been watching some “real life in prison” videos on youtube and i’m applying what i learned to my understanding of voyager the crew must have felt like they were in prison the situations are similar same location same people can’t go where you want have to obey the authorities what people are the happiest in prison homeless people they are happy just to have a roof over their heads and regular food to eat this is like neelix  that’s why he’s so cheerful all the time i wish this had been shown more clearly in the show if he had told a bunch of “down on his luck” stories he wouldn’t be seen as a cheerful idiot “hey harry did i ever tell you about the time i had nothing to eat but the slime mold that grew on the inside walls of my spaceship for a year”if we saw this side of neelix people would give him more respect,neelix was like a homeless guy in prison

3740,startrek,i dont get what you would buy with latinum when you can just replicate anything you want even if it cant do complex stuff like ships it can create it part by part and use robots to build which could also just be created with a replica i am just very confused on this idea,what is the use of latinum
3741,startrek,so i just finished up the two parter personally i freaking loved janeway here she was livid rightfully so and was not putting up with anyone’s shit it really cemented for me her being my personal favorite captain i consider sisko the best overall but simply adore janeway what i love about her as a character is how badass she is she has no fucks to give when she’s angry and it’s amazing this year of hell scientific method she’s willing to take everyone down her anger here reminded me of sisko’s fight with eddington but taken up for 11 i couldn’t stop saying ‘damn’ during my watch,janeway in equinox
3742,startrek,i felt connected to the crew like i was part of it the first time i watched itit is such a shame the way it ended i am wondering if we hold a fundraiser we can get a fifth season even though probably not,enterprise was the best series imo
3743,startrek,discovery is a bad show  there i said it  its not just a bad star trek show its a bad show  be honest with yourself: if someone wrote out the script of the first three seasons of discovery as fan fiction you would ridicule them  they have this magical spore drive that lets them travel through the mycillium network operated by a guy named paul stamets   cmon for fucks sake  this is asinine why do they care about what happens 1000 years in the future  do you care about what  happens in the year 3020  are you going to get butthurt if you find out that a so ln are flare rendered all em energy inert or that all the oil suddenly exploded who fucking cares  if t hff is was s voyager episode t hff ey would get back to their time line and none of it ever happened  oh yeah can we have one white male human bridge officer i get that the show is so fucking woke but how about one white male human who isnt gay  why not because it matters except for the fact that you cant be diverse if you intentionally exclude a very prominent demographic  they ruined the kligons  they ruined the trills  they ruined the vulcans  and the entire universe-- for 1000 years-- revolves around spock histrionic sister who for some reason doesnt use contractions when she speaks the seed vault for the entire federation is on a ship crewed by a family on earth today our seed vault is buried in a mountain fortress in norway  this show is just one insult after another,its ok to not like discovery youre not betraying the spirit of stsr trek by not liking discovery
3744,startrek,especially in voyager where theyre lost,does star trek ever cover the psychological effects of the crew not being exposed to real sunlight/day night cycles so effectively being in perpetual night
3745,startrek,why did he not come away with sudden new enlightening information of spocks adopted sister who flew around in a ship that could instantly jump from one point in space to another and then saved all of sentient life by leaping into the future in a secret ship starfleet had tried to erase from history,if picard mind-melded with sarek discovery season 2 spoilers
3746,startrek,in the first 15 seconds he was on screen i was prepared to be annoyed by his characterinstead i think he was a really refreshing personality and i think everyone in the world deserves a friend like that romantic or not  i hope there is more of him going forward,grey tal
3747,startrek,i recently rewatched generations for the umpteenth time and something occurred to me  i believe that it would be safe to assume that the enterprise wreak would have been scrapped out as part of a cleanup effort but what of the body of kirk  would he be left to rot in the stone cairn that picard made or would starfleet set up a proper burial back on earth for its most famous hero  would the federation erect a permanent memorial at the site  certainly jean-luc would have reported everything that had happened and thus disclosing the location of the makeshift gravealso do you think that this was a good send off for the character,james t kirk
3748,startrek,we already know that the supply of dilithium was getting low as mentioned in a previous episodefurthermore the holograms who interrogated georgiou mentioned a chimeric strain found in the dna of those from the mirror universeis it possible that the federation made a deal with mirror universe terrans to buy/trade dilithium could that dilithium also be unstable at a certain frequency in the prime universealong those lines might we have a scenario where vulcan/romulan sb-19 technology for space travel somehow interfered with dilithium from the mirror universepoke holes in this please,mirror burn

3758,startrek,i have the 2006 tos enterprise keepsake from hallmark the ship lights up if connected to its battery base stand which also plays the star trek theme the connector on the base stand is clearly the ‘male’ connector for standard christmas tree light bulbs and the enterprise has the female sockethowever with christmas tree lights the female is on the cable i can’t figure out how to connect the two i think it’s clearly intended to do so as the ornament is designed to be hung on a tree and the cable would fit it i found the right endi guess i’m looking for a male-to-male christmas tree light cable to do the job anyone know where to get one or have an alternative solution,has anyone tried to “wire in” their star trek hallmark keepsake to christmas tree lights
3759,startrek,i’m asking you all because we have a better collective memory of things with discovery jumping ahead there isn’t exactly a blank slate of the future after picard  the crews of each franchise had windows to that future examples are: - the kleptomaniac on tng from their past who stole a time ship from a dude in the future - a time ship in 20th century san francisco that provided the doctor’s mobile emitter - all the temporal civil war stuff in enterprise i’m curious if you all can remember what year these ships and people are from and how they might relate to discovery’s current yearand what other “travelers or technology from the future” have popped up in the various shows  i always think that the time ship in “year of hell” is federation but i don’t think it is,what do we know of the “future”
3760,startrek,im curious i was reading these are the voyages volume 3 and could not help thinking about who might get an unfairly bad reputation on the production side i mean part of me feels fred freiberger gets scapegoated for a lot of tos season 3 but a lot of incidents are brought up where gene roddenberry made decisions that impacted the later series does anyone else have others who might be in the same boat or at least debatable,whos someone in production who you think gets a bad rap

3762,startrek,weve obviously seen was close quarter combat in the trek universe looks like klingons attempting to storm ds9 etc but i dont think weve ever seen large scale trek battles  how would that work  lets say in what you leave behind the founder doesnt order her soldiers to lay down their guns  when the alliance starts sending in ground troops would they just start beaming soldiers to tactical points of interest or would they land tanks artillery etc  both  do we even know  is there a book or something that deals with this subject,domion war ground comabat
3763,startrek,greetings all fellow trekkiesi’ve wanted a first contact era uniform for as long as i can remember what with the ‘rona lockdowns and holiday season upon us i’ve decided to start looking in to what it takes to get a uniform that being said there’s a metric *shit ton* of uniform stuff out there from crappy $2999 chinese knockoffs on wish to $900 jackets on etsy it’s a bit overwhelming to that end- i’m a big guy 6’5 and a solid 235lbs most off the rack or “xl” stuff just doesn’t fit me sleeves too short chest too tight etc i have to order primarily through big and tall stores because nothing ever fits am i relegated to having someone just making a fully custom suit  is there a legit decent outfitter out there than can be sent my measurements and make me a uniformtia,where or how to get a bespoke st uniform
3764,startrek,just re watching the voyage home and it got me thinking about time travel in star trekok slingshot around the sun temporal anomalies the prime directive in the past or future what are your thoughts should star trek writers stay away from the concept of time travel as it can create big problems with regard to cannon and continuity but at the same time tell excellent stories like the aforementioned voyage home,time travel

3777,startrek,something occured to me the other day about the mirror universeterran history diverged from human history since at least zefram cochranes time and likely well before then ent: in a mirror darklyit would be unbelievably unlikely that hundreds or thousands of years after diverging that any of the same people exist in both universes given the differences between terrans and humans people would choose partners differently or die before reproducing or any number of other factors would lead to entirely different sets of people in both universeshowever in all the mirror universe episodes across the franchise everyone always has a counterpartobviously the real answer is that it is a convenient plot device but this must imply some kind of metaphysical reason that explains it in universe does the universe require balance on an individual level what about the ships that are carbon copies of each other with different paint jobs even crews can remain largely the same between them the implications of any reason for this could be very profound if exploredas far as i remember this idea has never been touched on in the franchise but it would be cool if they did,implications of mirror universe duplicates
3778,startrek,as the title says could they store injured people in the pattern buffer in order to treat them laterit would make it much easier to deal with those medical emergencies that we see where the staff are running around like crazy trying to triage and treat everyone just beam some patients into the pattern buffer and deal with them lateror in that voyager episode latent image where the doctor has his memory wiped because he flips out after having to choose between saving harry kim and some random ensign they could have just beamed her in there and saved her later after saving harry,in a medical emergency couldnt they just store people in the transporter pattern buffer
3779,startrek,marked for discovery spoilers  so im relatively new to the show introduced through discovery &amp; picard working my way through next generation currently so feel free to make me aware of inaccuracies but these two schools of thought genuinely fascinate me not so much for their differences but for their similaritiesif i understand it correctly:* vulcan philosophy seeks purely the path of logic in order to find and express the ultimate truth* the qowat milats way of absolute candour seeks purely emotional transparency to find and express the ultimate truthdespite the opposing method of revealing the truth the essence of their intent is the same and the self-discipline meditation training etc required to achieve these extremities is also very similarto combine them so that is to be both emotionally honest and logically sound-minded would be a very powerful philosophy to maintain knowing you are speaking truthfully about your emotions implies you are distinctly aware of what those emotions are awareness of their existence allows you to better understand their source and nature to then temper but not repress these emotions based on their source but as an onlooker through a locus of logic would result in an answer that is both emotionally aware and logically sound this would likely achieve more in a socially diverse society like nivar that requires solutions to a range of viewpoints than it ever would in a homogenous society like on old vulcanperhaps this would be the ultimate philosophical understanding burnham needs to come to in discovery in order to properly find her place again not only in starfleet but also as a member of vulcan and human society her conclusion to withdraw her request in the latest episode could point towards this developmentare there any examples of vulcans or romulans like this in canon id love to know \\,similarities between the way of absolute candour &amp; vulcan philosophy discussion
3780,startrek,what i really mean is how important is the position of first officer importantin tos spock was the science officer he was also the first officer but really most of the time to anyone watching he was a science officer his uniform was science-blue not command-gold sure hed sit in the captains chair when kirk was away but aside from that he didnt have any big first-officer-duties as far as i can recallin tng however riker was the full-time first officer without any other role the enterprise d is a heck of a lot bigger so it makes sense they might need more management-type positions to organize the crewwith discovery were back to a small crew so i wonder if the formal position of first officer is necessary yes of course someone has to be second-in-command since thats how the chain of command works but it seems like they could have gotten away with demoting burnhams and just making sure someone besides saru outranks her,does a ship really need a first officer

3787,startrek,im writing this with an open mind as a lifelong fan of trek hoping that someone can perhaps answer my criticisms in a way that might make me see discovery differently  i grew up watching tng with my dad ive watched every episode of every show multiple times -- even enterprise which i thoroughly enjoyed despite the general consesus that it wasnt all that good in discoverys first two seasons i had the same problems as everyone else mostly around how the show seemed to trample all over established canon but despite this i more-or-less enjoyed the first two seasons but i find myself unable to stomach the third season ill jump right into the reason why:  in season 3 being 900-years out of place has forced the crew to come together as a family this is a character-building element that a lot of fans wish voyager had had more of but with voyager the maquis / starfleet angle got resolved much too soon everyone but belanna seemed completely resigned to the realities of their lifelong journey almost immediately and its as if janeways decision to continue running the ship as if it were still a starfleet vessel in the alpha quadrant curtailed either the writers desire or ability to portray voyager as a nascent family rather than a crew of colleagues discovery wont make the same mistake: a crew stranded among strangers naturally becomes a family ok good but we know \*nothing\* about over half the regulars on the show and for me that completely undermines the overarching story theyre trying to tell  in season 3 the bridge crew arent individuals; theyre a singular character -- the bridge officers -- that get brought out for honestly cringy campy scenes like reminiscing under the tree at starfleet academy or sharing a meal with saru or smiling and going ah cool as they get new badges or one-by-one telling tilly to just say yes despite the fact that she may be the most unqualified commanding officer that weve ever seen it would be like janeway giving harry kim the position as first officer over chakotay or tuvoc but if harry kim had no self-confidence or leadership qualities whatsoever but why did tilly get the nod well who else could have who is rhys who is bryce who is owosekun i had to look up her name because i forgot who is the blonde woman whose name i literally dont even know despite the fact that shes in every scene with the bridge crew what do we know about detmer besides the fact that she has ptsd from flying the ship through the wormhole   the bridge crew are basically extras they show up once in awhile smile clap give each other hugs and then we get back to the michael burnham show and i didnt mind it being the michael burnham show during seasons 1 and 2 sure it bothered me that the bridge crew were an irrelevant afterthought without backgrounds whose names i couldnt even remember most of the time but it wasnt detrimental to the overarching narrative in season 3 however the writers are trying to tell me that these clearly irrelevant afterthoughts that theyve put zero effort into fleshing out are actually characters with depth; a family that i should care about when commander nhan decided to stay behind i thought ok who cares the only things i knew about her were things i had learned 5 minutes prior in that very same episode but her decision to stay was supposed to carry weight -- were losing a member of the crew and imagine we knew more about her than any of the bridge crew and she \*wasnt even part of the discovery crew\*  and thats the problem for me: there is no crew theres michael burnham theres saru only from the halfway point of season 2; prior to that were \~20 episodes with a first officer we knew hardly anything about and to a lesser extent there are stamets tilly and georgiou but the family that discovery insists exists is a farce and the insistance that it isnt only makes me want to know more about the bridge crew -- to understand them as individuals to fall in love with them like i have the crews of the various enterprises ds9 and voyager and i keep expecting the show to develop the bridge crews characters but it never does and so for me season 3 took the fact that the bridge crew are clearly an afterthought from annoying to inexcusable i dont know that i can watch another 7 or 8 episodes in which rhys smiling or detmer being stressed is considered character development  am i wrong i love star trek so much and i want so badly to love discovery too it wasnt so hard when all i had to do was pretend that the spore drive somehow fit with canon or pretend that the new klingons didnt look a bit silly; but now the shows asking me to pretend that its invested in characters who may as well be nameless and yet i see online that the general consensus among fans is that season 3 is incredible what am i missing help me love discovery too,i so desperately want to love discovery -- and its crew please help
3788,startrek,honestly i  love cbs content even before nbc the office but i wish they didn’t have such a sway into the future of star trek i’m about 2 seasons into ds9 after watching tng a solid 3 times enterprise the full 1-10 movies multiple times in sequence and tos they’re all clearly distinctively different and unique and that’s very much art i just hope for something to come for ds9 ds9 is a neglected child tng has most seasons in 1080p with remastered models and updated effects and film same with tos i really do think that tos has  significant improvements with the remasters especially in retrospect when you compare disney and star wars getting so many modifications from the original theatrical release etc who do we need to contact from cbs to get remastered ds9 they must have original film or digital archives the effects are all something around 480p this franchise deserves better all i’m saying is put in the ***legitimate*** effort i’m one of countless others they will buy a copy of blu-ray ds9 with remastered effects audio picture etc it’s a disgrace that the primary source is netflix with at best 480p to 1080p upscales tl;dr; cbs please give us an hd deep space 9 &lt;3if you have any pull with cbs please make it so number one i know you guys are all about the money but even if you don’t make it i’m sure you’ll at least break even 🥺🥺sincerely  a dedicated trekkie tm,ds9 and hd

3791,startrek,it feels like too many big moments and character paths diverge from the main universe in the mirror that it only seems that it is a reflection only as it observed like an actual mirror thoughts,mirror universe: because the universe and the characters in it don’t ever recall their own history is it crazy to believe that the mirror universe is simply a reflection at the point in time it is observed by someone from the prime universe and doesn’t have its own history
3792,startrek,i think its quite obvious on the surface that bajor is an allegory for india they both went through a long occupation by a foreign force they both are deeply religious talking about religion specifically the bajorans just like the hindus had a caste system that determined their jobs and other things called djarras that makes them have a quite close connection however the most unusual connection is their history of flight much like the bajorans there is a hindu text called the vimanas which details how to create a possible spacecraft or aircraft the bajorans also had text that showed how to build a solar wind based space craft and by building a replica sisko proved it was true this made the bajorans the first to achieve space travel im not saying that whats in the vimanas is true but its quite crazy how theyre so incredibly similar so thats why i think bajor being representative of india isnt just a surface level thing,bajor is an allegory for india but on a deeper level
3793,startrek,i was watching tng the other day and decided to rewatch the chaos on the bridge ocumentary but its weird its just seemed to disappear form every streaming service it had previously been on im not sure why are there rights issues at play,has chaos on the bridge disappeared
3794,startrek,many dislike ent however i really really like it how it was at the beginning being so naive relatively weak etc i love the lyrics to the intro music its been a long roadgetting from there to here and they usually bring tears to my eyes as i remember some parts of my life that i felt that way when my daughter got her first job in her field before that it was her graduation etc recently i was really the r/starlink thread and many people in the beta testing areas are saying just exactly that same phrase its been a long road for then to get high speed internet in their part of the world that either had no internet service crappy expensive wireless or super expensive slow satellite service from other providers so once again that song touches me as i imagine the joy of those families being able to make video calls for the first time with friends and relatives during this pandemic their kids being able to finally actually have a usable connection to attend class remotely etc for many of us theres always a long road that weve travelled and ent was the show that made that clear for me all the others had their own roads to travel too,star trek: enterprise and intro song

3799,startrek,- this episode features scientists who have discovered some of the unfortunate consequences of trying to genetically modify humans my question is how is this research allowed by the federation as we learn in ds9 and other part of canon genetic modification is highly discouraged as a result of the eugenics wars and the unintended side effects of genetic modification  beyond the laws against genetic modification isnt it highly unethical to create children in a lab and raise them like guinea pigs purely for observation - i am curious others views on this episode bc it has puzzled me for a long time especially as this issue of genetic modification is not discussed at all in the episode and no one on the enterprise seems to have an issue with the research its self or the fact that the federation is raising super children in labs,tng: s2 ep8: unnatural section

3807,startrek,the common wisdom regarding the episode is that was both ridiculous and silly; i respectfully disagree the federation is portrayed as a paradise where all problems have been solved yet in spite of their supposed enlightenment future humans struggle to appreciate cultures that are too unlike their own aside from dax who among the crew respects ferengi culture its a bit close minded to regard them as being culturally primitive when their history is free of large scale wars and other blights humanity not only suffered but came close to destroying themselves withenter the watti sisko is not only completely put off by their lack of interest in star fleet first contact protocols he apparently spent several hours at quarks bar watching them play games without ever once trying to engage them on that level he even refers to their game playing as childish when he speaks to jake later while being stuck inside of a game with no idea of what is in store for you might be scary even after he sees everyone is fine after the game is over sisko still tears into the watti representative its hardly a wonder we never see them againmove along home might be one of the clearest examples of the federations hypocrisy in ds9 they want to encounter new life and new civilizationsjust as long as they arent *too* new the bajorans need more aid well theyll just have to become more like us and join up whats that the cardassians are breaking another treaty and behaving savagely oh well we need to appease them and send them more industrial replicators than we gave the bajorans because sisko being the emissary means weve got them in the bag right because we want them to be part of the federation too never mind that making no sense at all this episode should have pushed harder on that,i wish move along home had been taken more seriously by the writers
3808,startrek,i was watching the second episode of lower decks and someone dont know all the characters names yet mentions that there are kaylons nearby arent kaylons from the orville does star trek have kaylons too if so what are they like the character who mentioned them said that theyre isolationists thats consistent with what theyre like on the orville at least,wait star trek has kaylons now

3827,startrek,i started out watching tng episode by episode this is when i grew up and the nostalgia of it was really fulfilling now i’m nearing the end of star trek og where do i go from here which series would be best after this sequence and what are your thoughts on the best sequence altogether did i do it wrong thanks live long and prosper,which series order to watch is the best order in your opinion
3828,startrek,they should have named it unification iv or unification v and left it for *picard* or other series down the road to fill in the gaps,my only grief with unification iii
3829,startrek,after watching unification  3 so michael has centred   her way into spocks life and history again with no **believable substance** he is the man he was today because of her does this ever stop how is she still taking the credit for everything that makes spock spock forget kirk and mccoy every action will wants  and need spock does is because of his older foster sister burnham&amp;#x200b;geez it would not surprise me if orci reveals in the reboots that part of the reason spocks is attracted and dates uhura is because uhura has some of the characteristics that reminds him of  michael burnham orci did write star trek 2009 i see this story line coming if uhura ever shows up in strange new world the michael thing needs to stop its just sad how they inserted her into unification  that were such classic star trek episode an episode that was more about sarek and spock finding some kind of peace,michael is responsible for all the good things of mr spock
3830,startrek,,so when exactly does the combadge need to be tapped
3831,startrek,it is the first time im watching tng and i have just seen the outcast  an interesting episode in which riker falls for soren an androgynous shuttlecraft pilot even nowadays with gender affairs being openly debated i found the episode provocative and well-written despite the cruelty in the last scenes can you imagine this on tv in 1992   as season 5 became more popular every day many critics raise questions concerning the way the episode depicts an allegory for sexual identity one issue is that soren identifying herself as a female was not mandatory in the story  in any case i am trying to look at this episode from another perspective what struck me the most is how intense the will-soren relationship becomes and this dialogue between will and deanna:\---w: i met someone - someone who has become important to me d: sorenw: yes youre my friend i thought i dont know i thought i should tell youd: im glad you didw: nothing will change between us will it d: of course it will all relationships are constantly changing but well still be friends maybe better friends youre a part of my life and im part of yours that much will always be truewill smiles and kisses her   \---  imo the message here is that we as human beings are mutable we keep changing the way we identify ourselves our sexuality the way we perceive others  therefore our relationships must be as dynamic as we are despite all the controversy of the conversion therapy at the end of the episode i considered this episode completely underrated what are your thoughts do you think will as an egocentric man could have really loved soren,perceptions about the outcast tng s05 e17 in 2020
3832,startrek,anyone get that impression from watching episodes like datas day and times arrow,someone on the tng staff really liked westerns
3833,startrek,i somewhat followed the saga of whether or not it would be possible to remaster ds9 and voyager in hd like they did with tng short version: too many effects to remake so not gonna happenhow feasible would it be for cbs all access / paramount plus to fit the bill and keep it an exclusive on their servicedisney plus has recently done this for a legacy series that hasnt been announced yet so im wondering if cbs/paramount has considered something similar it would help bring in some subscribers as they gear up for the re-launch,ds9 and voy in hd on cbs all access / paramount plus
3834,startrek,,your opinion of discovery
3835,startrek,,ketwolski interview with lower decks showrunner mike mcmahan worth a listen
3836,startrek,i agree that worfs relationships to females have always been a bit old fashioned and his relationship with alexander was always a bit strained but in tng it was always framed as being because this is literally a war ship that is nearly destroyed like every day and im a klingon and this is just how klingon relationships arebut on ds9 its entirely different on ds9 hes just openly hostile and dismissive of his son and even though at the end of the episode he had a little dad speech and apologized he still went back to basically going out on an infinite trip to the gas station for space milk and trashing on alexander behind his back whenever he got a chanceeven ezri made a comment about this when they were captured together at the end of the series not to mention after jadzia died he basically attacked julian and harassed ezri during every one of their encounters just because he was childishly and stubbornly stuck thinking i cant date her because shes not jadzia but also literally no one else is ever allowed to date her because she was jadzia or else shes a whore he even called her a slur that was heavily implied to mean something akin to slut during the previously mentioned episode just because she went on a date with someone who wasnt him even though from ezris point of view he had been ignoring her and avoiding/being rude to her since they first met maybe something like that could have been played off in early tng as hes young and confused and raised outside of his culture and just doesnt understand but by this point hes a grown middleaged man with an adult son,why did ds9 make worf into such an irredeemable dbag
3837,startrek,hi i have never seen star trek i have only seen parodies from popular culture from clips that i have seen of the show i guess i never watched it because i was put off by the idea of having some person wearing slightly longer ears and then calling them an alien when they are almost identical to an average human being and could in fact be considered human just with a certain personality stuff like that seems absurd to me and so much of science of the show is very likely outdated by now if it had any science in there i am sure it had at least some but recently i have seen discussions that suggest to me that star trek actually tackles many interesting philosophical and moral ideas i love natural sciences and philosophy and all that and i was never into star wars is this show for me,some opinions please
3838,startrek,picard with red nailswhile watching star trek the next generation season 3 episode 25 transfigurations my son pointed out that picard has red nails i never noticed this and it was the 7th or 8th time i was watching this episode does anybody know why he had red nails in that episode,why does picard have red nails
3839,startrek,the latter point happens mostly in tng it seems natural to see now after seeing it so many times but its still always something ive noticed there will just be a dip or lull in the conversation and one party will turn 180 degrees and just walk the fuck out as for the privacy thing the door locks may as well not exist because basically anyone with the authorization to override them has absolutely no qualms with doing so basically every time they decide to drop in on a friend being friends with an officer would be so stressful you could never change clothes or take a bath or whatever without worrying about hearing the door ring twice in 5 seconds also rude by the way then just having your boss strut right in like they arent just trying to catch a peek of some nipunless youre riker in which case you have no nipples now much of this you could explain away by saying well theyre all just good friends but theres a ton of specific examples of this behavior that just preclude that like when ezri does it to an admittedly dead upon her arival ensign she had met the night before in ds9 or basically the entire beginning of tng,no one in star trek respects the privacy of anyone else they also always just walk away abruptly mid conversation
3840,startrek,im curious if this captain is explored in any of the new or older trek offerings besides tos seems like an interesting character who was held in the highest regard by kirk at least for a time,captain garth tos s3e14
3841,startrek,get a bunch of ensigns and have them holding hands in a holodeck the two on each end touching their respective opposite walls then you load a program where the computer tries to place each one in a location very distant from each other the computer will try to render holograms that gives each ensign the illusion of being miles from the other ensigns yet theyre still holding hands the ensigns on the ends are touching wall so they cant go any further in one direction,how does the holodeck computer solve the how many ensign can you squeeze into a holodeck problem
3842,startrek,i realized that when several crew members get sucked out of the enterprise while its fleeing admiral marcus at warp during star trek into darkness theres nothing to slow those corpses downif the enterprise was on a direct course for earth when it jumped to warp speed those bodies are going to hit the atmosphere like small bombs,a body at warp stays at warp
3843,startrek,soong must have created a digestive system and a pooping subroutine otherwise i think youd wonder why you were eating but never pooping,if juliana odonnell was made to fool everyone that she was human including herself
3844,startrek,this is one of those trek episodes that haunts you afterwards it makes you continue to think about it long after youve turned the tv off personally i think i probably wouldve made the same decision on rather simple grounds: you either kill two men or just one those were the options of course there was that one episode where they transferred a consciousness into a hologram to allow someone to live on and they couldve perhaps used that as a 3rd option where they dont have to really make a choice but thats just it doing so avoids the question that is at the episodes center: which is the moral option what do you guys think,what would you have done if you were in janeways position to handle the tuvix situation
3845,startrek,,help me find a tng episode the contents of the episode were very frustrating for the crew and it ends with picard or riker telling the conn something like set a course where anywhere but here
3846,startrek,is there a canon map of the dominions territorial losses and gains ala ww2 atlas style during the dominion war  it would be sorta interesting to know the exact extent of their what they occupied in the federation how far they pushed in  &amp;#x200b;for that matter is there an actual canon map of the cardassian union or the unfp  ive seen several many of them looking fairly different,dominion war map
3847,startrek, i dont see how i get that the ship was not destroyed but in the records the ship was destroyed and time travel was banned so they probably did that to cover it up that they came from the past,*spoiler ive been seeing some people say that giving the discovery an a at the end of the registry breaks the rules of normal ships
3848,startrek,,*spoiler how come the discovery crew hasnt changed uniforms yet they already got the new comm badge and they already refitted the ship but no new uniforms
3849,startrek,,the borg were a metaphor for colonialism: taking your distinctiveness and forcably adding it to their own and in doing so erasing you utterly
3850,startrek,so i’ll admit when i first started i had a lot of problems it was hard getting used to the modern settings - well extra super cgi futuristic stuff we can do these days after binging 80’s and 90’s for months it took some adjusting but i’m beginning to adapt even though it’s not as cozy and i miss the kitsch factor we will need 50 years for this to be kitsch the characters took me a bit to warm up to that is the new ones but once i did i really did i love their chemistry and everyone is cast so perfectly and diversely as always on trek i’m very impressed with the diversity having seven and picard together in the same show and old tng faves back is magical i love love love the rikers kid she’s so well cast although she doesn’t look anything like her parents but she’s great anyway :the cinematography is beautiful space looks very realistic that borg cube finally looks like the massive implosive and complex threat that it should be i appreciate seeing old favorite artifacts given their full splendor and potential i love the story i want it to continue i’m hooked on the plot and i will be sad when the last episode that i’m on ends in a few minutes the new season can’t come soonernow i don’t know what to watch in the meantime 😭,i’m finally warmed up to picard
3851,startrek,im always glad when i see star trek looking forward into what space flight would be like wspecially extended space flight beside artificial gravity and other things they didnt cheap out on how space flight would be achieved i was watching tng where the get caught in a interstellar boobie trap they get caught in some form of radiation somehow it causes their shields to begin decaying dr crusher mentions how once the shield goes down the radiation will effect the crew and passengers all hands will die after 30 minutes of exposure although it isnt stated you can imagine the shields were not initially designed for protecting the ships from attack but more likely interstellar radiation its a real issue with space flight today we may not be able to withstand the radiation once we travel outside the atmosphere nothing is really protecting us anymore we get hot with so much uv radiation that our cells die off that is why we are researching so that when we leave it can be for longer than a trip to the moon of course i dont think the iss is so far outside the farthest layers of our atmosphere that it matter a huge amountsorry for the tangent  it i love how star trek isnt like star wars you cant just do whatever you want it still exists in our world of physics and consequence i appreciate the extent the writers went to to keep the show as practical as possible especially the original series which came out before we went to tge moon you get a feeling that you arent watching a adventure show rather the procedural life on a research vessel in our galaxy its amazing i wish i would have found this show sooner,well ahead of its time
3852,startrek,is it just me or does the crew of the discovery tend to cry all the time at this point humans are supposed to be scientifically and emotionally woke i get that they’re 900 years into the future and away from all they know and love and feel really emotional but they tend to cry over every little matter instance 1: when michael burnham gets demoted from first officer after knowingly disobeying the captains order to go and rescue book why does she have to cry she should’ve known the consequences for her actions will have an effect on the image the crew is trying to from with the new federation instance 2: when tilly gets assigned as the acting first officer why does she need to cry and hug michael and make that a whole emotional moment not denying that she had to face michael regarding the whole “i’m taking your post” thing but crying all the time makes them seem so compromised and vulnerable when it should be the exact oppositethe second one seems a bit weak and there’s been multiple instance of such unprofessionalism from the crew that i have observed i am not saying that there shouldn’t be a portrait of emotions because that would just seem lame and inhuman but can we reel it in with the scenes where crying shouldn’t really be a thing from the level of professionalism that is meant to be portrayed the managerial side of starfleet in the future is so composed and calm and logical this is just my opinion but it’s something to ponder on,scientifically woke emotionally not so much star trek: discovery
3853,startrek,,great moment from geordi in tng
3854,startrek,next week we heard to booker’s home planet under attack from osyraa per the synopsisi’m thinking the teaser from last week of stamets announcing the location of the start of the burn - especially since it was at the start of the teaser - is a bit of a red herringwhy i don’t know but because next week’s and the week after’s are “terra firma” parts i and ii i’m thinking that earth intentionally triggered the burnagain why i don’t know we see that 100 years later they’ve become isolationist and xenophobic so maybe that’s something related to it,a theory on the burn
3855,startrek,dont get me wrong  i liked tasha fine  she was no better or worse than any of the other bland characterizations of secondary characters in the 1st season  but the show was really crowded  too many actors to get pushed to the side and with tasha gone you had worf take his rightful place heading securitythink about the original trek: you had two leads kirk and spock two secondaries mccoy and scott and then 3 or 4 recurring background characters that may or may not get much dialogue at all sulu uhura and rand for the 1st season chekov the 2nd  thats only 7 with most of them more background than anything else  note: yes i know one could argue that mccoy was a leadbut with tng they switched to more of an ensemble cast with 1 lead and 8 secondaries which all had more screen time than than their counterparts on tos  that makes for a very bloated cast in story-telling  im not a wesley hater but for the simple reason of space he should have never been a cast member either  if anything i would have rather seen tasha at the helm and dump troi entirely as she was not necessary to the crewin any case whichever characters are your least favorites actor bloat meant someone had to go   and by actor bloat im not talking about jonathan frakes  love ya big guy thoughts,denise crosby leaving tng was the best thing that happened to the show
3856,startrek,this is the webcomic follow-up to tng episode the inner light both written by morgan gendel any help would be appreciated,does anyone know where i can read the outer light
3857,startrek,,it is green - the tos + tng easter egg
3858,startrek,and i’m afraid to finish it i know i’ll be left in the biggest show hole i’ve dedicated so much of my time to this show it’s weird to see it almost at an end,i’ve only got 8 episodes of ds9 left
3859,startrek,i think what the federation should do is build mobile shipyards  huge ships that have dry dock facilities to build smaller ships  and that have the ability to mine fuel and raw materials as they travel through space  that way they could build their ships on the fly  and they could use holograms and robots to build ships faster then humans can  they could send one of these ships to an unexplored region and by the time it got there it could have constructed dozens of ships  that way one ship becomes dozens and even hundreds  the mobile shipyard could even be designed to be extended to build larger ships or other mobile shipyards  so send one of these ships to the edge of the delta quadrant and by the time it got there it could be thousands or tens of thousands of ships  if the federation built a dozen of these they could expand out to every corner of the galaxy  so anyway let me know what you think in the comments,mobile shipyards
3860,startrek,my older brothers used to collect star trek novels when i was a kid back in the late 80s and i remember one particular book that they had i dont remember the title or who the author was or if the story is any good but the cover left an impression on me i remember it had a bluish background with with both the enterprise im a bit fuzzy if it was the original design or the movie refit and a klingon d7 crusiser the cover showed both ships in fine detail to the point where you can see the windows on each ship there also appeared to be shuttles going between the two vessals could anyone out there give me any idea what the title of this book is  thank you all for any help you can give me,what is the title of this tos novel
3861,startrek,,mister worfs neighborhood #20
3862,startrek,i was under the impression that michaels quest to solve the burn was a weird obsession because albeit an understandable goal i cant see why its so urgent that shes breaking all the rules to do it immediately there is no reason to believe it would change anything in the short term is it discussing it with other people however it seems some are under the impression that solving it is would possibly or probably restore warp traveli researched it to the best of my abilities but i think were short on details so a few questions just to make sure im not missing anything:1 why is warp travel goneto my understanding the only thing stopping it is the lack of dilithium supply was already dwindling before and i think its implied that recrystallization isnt possible on a mass scale maybe because burned dilithium is useless so all they have left are the small quantities that survived for whatever reason fear that dilithium would explode again could stop some people from using it but it wouldnt stop the whole galaxy2 is there any reason to believe finding who or what caused the burn will bring warp back in the short termof course its tv so its possible that everything will be neatly solved in the end and idk maybe the bad guys behind the burn know how to fix burned dilithium or have been using alternative tech in secret this whole time but is there any reason for michael to believe that learning what happened will fix anything immediately because my impression is that she has this vague notion that if theres a threat behind it all the federation will never be able to safely rebuild which makes sense but hardly justifies lying and almost quitting starfleet not to delay the search for a week or two a good idea i just learned from another redditor is that if michael proves the burn was not caused by sb-19 the vulcans/romulans could get back to developing an alternative but that doesnt seem to be michaels plan at all and even then itd be hard to buy that every single person with access to that information and vulcans no less would stop studying the galaxys only hope something that could fix everything in a year if it there werent credible concernsso is there any way to explain the whole the burn drama except that michaels unreasonably obsessed with it,what details do we have on warp drive and dillithium on current discovery
3863,startrek,,mister worfs neighborhood #20 the idiot
3864,startrek,in the background behind the allasomorphs you can see this awesome looking neon ring lamp is this something i can buy or is there something similar i can buy,what lamp is this
3865,startrek,we see how the romulan people have adapted after the hobus supernova even reintegrating with the vulcans on nivar but what happened to their planetary neighbors on remus  we can only suspect that because they are a slave race and mostly are concentrated on remus that they might have all died out after the supernova  but do you think a small sect of remans still survived the supernova or do you think theyre all dead,what happened to the remans after the hobus supernova
3866,startrek,so i’ve rewatched tos the original series lately and i forgot how magical it was it was just gene roddenberry and the cast trying out a quirky new idea for a sci-fi series of which there was no lack of in the 60s and 70s i remember watching it for the first time and being amazed by this universe created back in the 1960s now we have the kelvin timeline mirror universe and even gods the prophets so in conclusion i think it was the best foundation to base an entire franchise off when i saw the pilot i wasn’t that amazed but after a few episodes i was taken back by itso what do you think,opinions on tos
3867,startrek,i have for the first time in my 16 years watched sisko be promoted to captaincy watching it i couldn’t help myself from smiling and even ended up singing along to “for he’s a jolly good fellow”ds9’s writers made me feel as though i was an invitee to sisko’s promotion partythis show means so much to me,sisko’s promotion
3868,startrek,what’s with all those teary momentsfeels like i’m watching some turkish soap opera instead of sci-fi,is everyone in discovery an emotional wreck
3869,startrek,love the newer series of trek or hate it but weve had a decent amount of it this year in 2020 we started off with the final episode of *short treks* in children of mars we then go into a 10 episode season of *picard* and then a 10 episode season of *lower decks* and now a 13 episode season of *discovery* to take us into the new year so as good as weve had it this year with content there is a large elephant in the room there has been little to no live action production this year start dates for picard section 31 strange new worlds have all been thrown out the window with only disco s4 recently beginning animated trek has managed to survive these delays for the most part and is going full steam aheadso it looks like 2021 is going to be a more vacant one but what could we see nextwell lower decks has a second season being produced side by side with the first so that is the next candidate for release sometime earlier in the year probably we then will likely go into star trek prodigys first season on nickelodeon in the middle of the yearand that could very well be it the live action shows have a 1 year turnaround and as most of them are set to start shooting next year we cant expect pic s2 snw s1 s31 s1 to be out until 2022 at the earliest the only other thing we could see in 2021 is disco s4 beginning to air sometime in december but that seems like it would almost certainly fall back to 2022 also and lord knows whats up with short treks for such an acclaimed series with such use youd think they would have announced something from it besides itd be interesting to do moretldr: looks like weve got 20 weeks of animated trek next year and by the looks of things we could end up seeing 6 seasons of trek in 2022 at best and a damn lot at worst,whats next on the schedule for trek
3870,startrek,im halfway through season 1 of the tng my first foray into anything star trek and am very much enjoying it im very spoiler-averse but enjoy podcasts or reading materials that will benefit my viewing whether it be episode-by-episode or by seasoncan anybody please recommend any spoiler-free pods or other materials i can enjoy alongside my first viewing of tngapologies if this is the wrong place for this type of post,first time viewer of tng looking for spoiler-free additional materials
3871,startrek,,discovery season 3 — the details of the federations uniforms
3872,startrek,i would imagine federation high command would be very interested when older spock reports on his timeline do you think the higher ups would have used his knowledge of the possible future to make changes they would be aware of the multiverse in some form or would old spock leave out many details i wonder just how he would explain nero and his time travel to the federation,federation in kelvin timeline aware of the multiverse
3873,startrek,,federation uniforms for dsc s3-star trek on cbs all access on twitter
3874,startrek,it’s never “myself and commander riker to beam up” or “beam geordi and the humanoid life form a metre and a half to his left directly to sickbay” it’s just four or five of them standing there three with com badges and two rando plot line characters and poor o’brien has to guess which onesi can watch data and wesley rebuild a warp coil out of salvaged tritanium/duridium alloy drinks cans and some anti matter that guinan whipped up in her cocktail shaker all damn day but the lack of proper transporter etiquette really pulls me out of the suspension of disbelief,“two to beam up energise” pisses me off
3875,startrek,,have you ever wanted to eat off an lcars interface now you can with this 16-peice dinnerware set
3876,startrek,so chakotay and neelix finds voyager with emh in command they try do rescue the crew but mostly fails and end up with very few crew end up rescued and very few are bridge officers janeway and torres stays for examplei wonder how would they manage with less than 50 crew or maybe 100,voyager ‘workforce’ what if
3877,startrek,first of all this is my first post on this sub so i hope i am doing this right :so im watching ds9 for the first time since a few weeks and when i saw looking for parmach in all the wrong places yesterday i noticed that the acting was somehow different its a little difficult to explain but it seemed like all the actors were on a whole new level of liveliness and motivation be it odo joking about kiras relationship with obrien dax while teaching quark how to use a bathleth or bashir while having a fun little chat with obrien - something just felt nrw about the way they portrayed their feelings after being a little confused at first i quickly began to love this new style of acting dont get me wrong - i loved all of the characters the way they were before and they dont act completely new in this episode but it feels like they have expanded their character traits to make them even better suited as before and there couldnt have been a better episode than this one to experiment with this new acting styledid anyone feel the same about this episode when they first saw it or is it just me and what do you think could be the reason for this rather interesting change anyway im gonna watch the next episode now to see if this was a unique thing or if they do this regularly from now on,the acting in ds9s looking for parmach in all the wrong places is quite interesting
3878,startrek,i was just watching an episode that has us in datas quarters and a random thought hit me  we see in the senior officers quarters that they have items on the shelves art etc  whenever the ship gets attacked and shaken do you think everything gets scattered all over their quarters so that when they get off duty they have to come back and pick everything up,crazy random thought in regards to officer quarters
3879,startrek,seasons 3 and 4 were excellent and rank up there with some of the best of the other shows imo it really is a shame they didn’t get three more years like the rest of the berman era i have to wonder what they would have done with it given the chance,i just finished my first time through enterprise i regret i didn’t watch it sooner
3880,startrek,i pretty sure everyone who remembers most of tos noticed that every time when gene touched screenplay it always turned into some kind of gladiator script bread and circuses is the brightest example of that although i like savage curtain he wrote a story that puts characters in a situation where they have to fight each other to please some higher power againhe did not write the gamesters of triskelion nor arena but these episodes got similar story tropes also there is an episode about ancient greece-like people who are more into roman types of entertainment platos stepchildren obviously gene didnt have to be a writer to put his favorite things in the script because he was the creator the producer and that was his vision after all regardless of who writes the storyi think gene thought that characters and societies that were based on decadent cruel aspects of ancient rome culture are the perfect antagonists to the starship crew that represents a utopian society like the federation or maybe he just loved the roman aesthetic i dont knowso what do you think,why gene roddenberry was so fixated on roman stuff
3881,startrek,i learnt it has a response a while back i can never remember it i looked it up just yesterday and have forgotten it again i know the response is rarely said but how is one expression so more memorable than anotherif someone could remind me of what it is again here im hoping that will make it stick forever,does anyone else have difficulty remembering the correct response to live long and prosper
3882,startrek,id be a starship architect  id design luxury private ships and star liners for wealthy clients,you are a merchant on the promenade of ds9 what kind of merchant are you
3883,startrek,something always bugged me about the episode and it is not the devolution why did worf think he could design a better guidance system for the photon torpedos than the brilliant engineers and scientists that starfleet uses and has dedicated for weapons design why did picard even let him trythat would be the same as letting the weapons officer on a surface combat ship remove the guidance system from the ship to ship missiles or cruise missiles and replace it with their own design,st:tng season 7 genesis
3884,startrek,my brother absolutely loves star trek and has always said that this certain thing they say on the show would be a great band name i was planning on making him some sort of fake merch of it for christmas but the full thing has completely slipped my mind i believe the first word/name is two syllables but i could be wrong help pls,what is the saying “ to sickbay”
3885,startrek,here are a few of them:these are pretty fun and linus one so far is the best,i dont know if anyone knows but there are cool little instagram posts with personal logs from the discovery crew
3886,startrek,i mean lets be real here guys:  i have been watching discovery since season 1 and in every scene there is sugar  sugar is the leading cause of:1  childhood obesity2  clogged arteries3  causes the crew to jump off the walls4  they wont be able to concentrate5  the burni mean look phillipa is always trying to kill someone what is wrong with that woman then i found out its all sugar  thats the cause of the burn they were trying to burn all those calories off from the sugarburn = sugar calories i knew it  this whole timethe crew really needs to cut down all that crying from coming down from sugar    they are also being bad starfleet officers what would the admiral think from the mummy maybe in his time sugar was used to kill that mummy but starfleet officers nodoes the spore drive run on mushrooms no its sugar  sorry but this show needs to cut down on the sugar,i dont like how sugary discovery is
3887,startrek,my continuing mister rogers/star trek mashup comic with a guest appearance by geordi in a familiar role check out this weeks strip at the link below where you can also find the entire seriesmister worfs neighborhood #20,mister worfs neighborhood #20
3888,startrek,what is that one error that you see in any trek that just makes you go ugh nofor me it is in tng disaster where they hit the quantum filament and everyone is in different parts of the ship trying to get it going again and troi doesnt know what a warp core breach is which is another nit crusher and laforge are stuck in the cargo bay and crusher says geordi this wall is hot and then geordi responds where what \*geordi\* asks where the wall is hot he cant tell where it is hot thats what his visor does fer cryin out loud all they had to do was switch the lines and it would have made sense i love the episode and think it is tons of fun but that moment gets me every single timewhat is your nuh-uh moment,your nit-pickiest nit-pick any series
3889,startrek,i have always thought picard was but a friend made me doubt,archer is the best captain
3890,startrek,so i was interested in growing some mushrooms for shits and giggles and started researching how to do it and i stumbled across a book by a mycologists named paul stametssince paul stamets on discovery was researching a spore drive that traveled across a mycelia network i was wondering if this was intentional or not but it seems to be too much to be a coincidencesorry if this was already known,til: paul stamets is a real world mycologist
3891,startrek,in star trek 2009 into darkness and beyond we really dont see many starships besides the enterprise if you exclude kelvin kitbash ships the vengeance special ship and franklin old pre kelvin-ship are itso im working on a kelvin timeline personal project and designing new starships that seem era appropriate built around the same time as the enterprisehere is the second one ive done the uss tyson named for neil degrasse tyson,in the abrams films we didnt really see many starships that werent kelvin kitbashes so i made one
3892,startrek,nothing too long under an hour and once weekly,good podcast about star trek
3893,startrek,,dukat claims the bajorians are stronger better due to the occupation im some ways hes right im only stating an opinion not going to defend it
3894,startrek,now by this i dont mean that i seriously believe that in 400 years were going to have the enterprise d that roddenberry was some prophet or that klingons really are out there but star trek has always been a part of my life it shaped my morals it helped to instill into me the values that all life is sacred to never judge by appearances that knowledge and strength are useless if not destructive if youve not the respect or discipline to wield them that what can seem to be a bloodthirsty enemy could just be someone scared lashing out and they just need a proper avenue to understand and learn that protecting the masses means ensuring the smallest of us have all of their rights and dignities intactmy perfect future would be one akin to what the federation has accomplished i truly feel the era of a united earth is closer now than ever before but we must take measures to ensure our equality and fairness i shudder to think of a world where the replicator has become a commonplace item but for greedy purposes it is restricted think about how electric cars have all but been shot in the kneecap because oil companies need their profits i base my political decisions and votes on a simple metric: will this help to push us down the path of star treks future i dont think star trek is some magical gospel but i do feel that people pick up their morals from the content they have absorbed over their lifetime be it sports human interactions or television/videogames/books in the end it is not necessarily the work itself but rather what you get out of that work harry potter for example is a series undergoing a critical self-look by the fandom finding many troublesome things within the work house elves being happy slaves just does not sit well for many but it is indisputable that many people were able to form their morals from the series morals such as: friendship is worth more than power love is a stronger force than anyone knows it is better to die protecting someone than to live only for yourself and thats what i keep coming back to yeah there are a lot of wacky adventures and somethings that despite apparently happening 500 years from now are downright dated but again and again i find myself looking at this fictional universe and thinking how can we bring ourselves to be closer to that and if you made it this far i really hope we dont have to suffer a ww3 induced thermonuclear winter to finally get our shit together as a species,star trek is the closest thing i have to a religion anyone else
3895,startrek,,preview ‘star trek: discovery’ episode 308 with new images from “the sanctuary”
3896,startrek,its written by the guy who wrote the episode he previously was in plus its weird they havent announced the director when theyve announced the directors of the episodes after,speculation so did cronenberg direct the upcoming terra firm two-parter in discovery
3897,startrek,remember star trek into darkness khan transported to the klingon home world from earth alpha to beta quadrant if that tech really existed in that time then why couldnt they build something like that in the 32nd centuryremember those transporters in star trek picard the ones at starfleet headquarters where you can simply walk through and then materialize somewhere else combine the distance of the khan transporter and those walk-in transporters and you have stargates no need for warp anymore just walk to another planet in another quadrant daisy chain those transport hubs and you can go anywhere in the galaxy by walking 100 metersthe federation can then live on and expand especially since personal transporters are a thing probably for short range but that means that the energy efficiency of transporters is super high in the 32nd century so maybe they can even build stargates for starships in orbit again no need for warp anymorethe few ships with warp can then position the stargates in orbit of member planets and rebuild the federationthey really messed up star trek with those creative ideas about tech it ruins the plots,why dont they use the transporter of star trek into darkness to transport to different planets in the 32nd century
3898,startrek,,as is our custom in this time of year i present captain picard singing for your holiday pleasure
3899,startrek,,as is traditional i hereby submit the annual holiday music post
3900,startrek,,sharing the eva foam klingon knife i built
3901,startrek,,a very merry christmas to /r/startrek from doug jones captain saru
3902,startrek,im rewatching from where i left off in the 90s: season 3whats interesting is that i can say that this is a totally cw show even enterprise was more berman than this this is weirdly totally cwive seen all of tng and ds9 and as a pair they are core trek ds9 is at its peak peak trek i never saw season 3 but ive watch 1&amp;2 and a few episodes of 4 tas and all of 5 stc of tos i consider the tos films to be core the tng films to be in that realm of meh okay lame but meh category of 90s films which the brosnan bonds occupyjj trek is alright but very different cbs trek all the way around is garbage for bad world building bad plot weird acting awful writing cheap setsbut voyager honestly it went on so long and is so very different it looks like tng/ds9 trek as i said enterprise had bits of its 90s tv style but enterprise was more berman-esque mostly in the vein of the tng films the fourth season was very good and focused almost into the ds9 realmvoyagerthis is as i said cw trekbut i love itit takes cheap cheezy pedestrian character drama that the other treks in spite of themselves did not have and elevates it it takes cw and elevates it to a very respectful star trek level of style lore and form it therefore produces almost like an enlightened version of what youd see in xena warrior princess its schlocky but sincere intellectual and worships the legacy of star trekits not ds9 or tng its its own thing but somehow its just really great in its own way its proof that trek can elevate thingsit proves why cbs trek is so bad because it belittles and lowers trek when trek should automatically lift up genres styles and properties,praise to voyager
3903,startrek,so i was watching a stream recently from discovery actor ian alexander and he banned a person from stream chat because they were transphobic after he did it ian remarked to chat how someone can be a star trek fan and be transphobic this inspired me to do this post what do you think do you think if someone for example is transphobic do you think they arent really a star trek fan one of the things star trek has taught me to embrace diversity our planet offers and not to judge people based on things like sexual identity of course i believe everyone has the right to believe what they want to but i  also think anyone who is racist like that they really havent learned the real lesson star trek teaches,what do you think
3904,startrek,i just watched ds9: a man alone in the episode a man kills a clone that he made of himself it is stated that this makes him a murderer parallel bashir ended up creating another clone because plot reasons and at the end of the episode they mentioned that this clone went off to start a new life for himselfso the takeaway is: its ok to clone people - no need to ask for permission and killing clones is no different from killing peoplebut then i remembered an episode of tng: up the long ladder as i recall its been a while since ive seen it dna is taken from riker and polaski without their permission to make clones when this is discovered riker destroys the clones riker faces no repercussions for this action and nobody suggests there was anything wrong with itin neither episode is any ethical question raised -- in one its simply a given that killing your own clone is acceptable and in the other its a given that killing your own clone is murder,ethics of cloning
3905,startrek,i miss bookmarks i had the enterprise e and odo and i dont get why they dont make them anymore people still buy and read books and youd think theyd be dirt cheap to make so the profit margin would be okay id get one with lorca and one with grudge,what star trek merch do you want to make a comeback
3906,startrek,,on tng they played poker the discovery cast plays d&amp;d
3907,startrek,personally i like the idea of the cage being officially s1e1 of strange new worlds versus a shelved pilot/tos special because1 who doesn’t love fun easter eggs like that2 it features the characters of snw3 it technically is the pilot episode in the sense that the dis crew got the idea to use these characters from that specific episode4 tos’s actual s1e1 was a soft reboot/second pilot anyways so tos isn’t really “losing” anything by “losing” it as an episodethoughts,debate - once the show is finally produced should “the cage” be considered a tng episode or a snw episode
3908,startrek,,this post reminds me of that episode on ds9 the quickening
3909,startrek,it seems on a weekly basis there is a post on here that makes it to the top about some negative aspect about discovery that is blown out of proportion i never thought people would complain discovery has too much emotion whilst tng etc had a motional moment or some crisis to solve every episode  all wrapped up in a 45 minute episode which ironically people are complaining aboutusually the mods lock or remove such topics but that was allowed until it got some 10 rewards and 2k+ upvotesas someone who tries to remain positive and upbeat it gets really sad to see something like that  do people not like *anything* about the new shows remember: i dont honestly care at this point what people think however you arent taking into account the people you *push away* because of this  people will look at this community and not feel welcomed i mean i donti am still surprised after 3 years people are still immaturely calling this show std  however you guys do what you like  there are people that are going to be pushed away and all that is left is the negativity some people need to come to a point where no matter what they do on the show i dont think the people who dont like it ever will  this projection on this show has gone beyond what makes sense,i dont like the negativity on star trek: discovery
3910,startrek,,what kind of star trek merch would you like to see that you havent before
3911,startrek,emotions are running high but i’m good kind of to be perfectly clear i’ve seen my favorite episodes dozens of times each and every episode at least once but even with my favorite shows i don’t do a complete series overhaul very often about three months ago i decided it was time to go through tng as a whole once more it reinvigorated my love of it all right oh i’ve always remained steadfast in my love of it sure but it can be another thing entirely to remain *passionate* after a certain amount of time away has elapsed the biggest takeaways were how much two episodes in particular grew on me: the defector and frame of mind i think because on my first watch through as a teen i never quite liked the romulan centric stories as much as klingon or even cardassian ones “they’re just unreasonable vulcans” i might have said and an episode like frame of mind was too out there for me back then i think but they rose quite a bit in my esteem this time around i’m afraid i have nothing substantive to add still a ball of nerves and just wanted an appropriate venue to calm down in but after that onwards  and upwards to ds9 i guess :d,just wrapped up my first tng rewatch
3912,startrek,whenever i look through this sub most dis posts are critiquing the show or wishing the writers had done something differently as a trekkie who loves dis i just wanted to list some things that dis does well **-the main cast are all incredible** yes the show is very much centered around smg but she does an amazing job her speech in the latest episode easily rivals classic trek speeches the rest of the cast is great too michel yeoh steals every scene shes in her and sonequa martin-greens scenes are always great doug jones has vaulted into the pantheon of trek captains in only a handful of episodes i love how saru is starfleet through and through while having a completly different style from any previous captain   \-**every episode this season has been a banger** every one has been a classic \~30 min trek episode with the burn as an intriguing b plot the seed vault and the nivar episodes are easily top 50 trek episodes getting a deep dive in to barzan culture was refreshing given how many trek races are so one note the misunderstood monster is a classic trek plot that was done really well watching that man suffer was legitimately heartbreaking this latest episode was just a classic lawyer trek episode it examined the consequence of a previous trek series without being overly fan servicy **-the representation is awesome** its just awesome and is something trek shouldve done ages ago \-**the ships and uniforms are awesome** when i first watched discovery i hated the uniforms and the angular ships but now i really like them the 31st century uniforms are similarly awesome and both compete with the tng movies/lateds9 uniforms for my favorite   i dont want to ramble on any more i just wanted to make this post because a lot of discourse surrounding dis has been negative and i would like to put something positive out there for myself and for others in the community who love dis,discovery appreciation post
3913,startrek,i was watching tng the episode were riker falls on love with soran from the androgynous speciesanyway in the middle of it riker visits deanna in her room and she is excited that she just received this package from her mother with pictures dolls and random crapwth do they have postal service that visits the ships i know its a rhetorical question i wonder if the writers gave it a thought on how that would work the enterprise is in the middle of a mission away from any base thats what made me thinkif i was asked to give an in universe explanation i would say: people scan whatever physical object they want to send and its translated and sent as data to the bases or starships and then the replicators use this data to re-create those physical objectsthoughts have this ever explained in any of the series,package deliveries tng
3914,startrek,set between tos and tng it follows the early careers of the tng bridge crew it could be animated and the same actors could voice their younger selves,new show idea: star trek - through the ranks
3915,startrek,i am rewatching ds9 and i just watched far beyond the stars and was completely shocked how real writing and acting looks no amount of cgi or special effects of the new star trek shows and movies can even touch ds9 and the older series storytelling why aren’t episodes like this one written anymore are writers really out of touch with what good content looks like can a new star trek show go 10 minutes without loud explosions and the camera zooming all over the place anyone else feel this way,ds9 - far beyond the stars: no comparison to discovery or picard
3916,startrek,and i’m in love again the heartbreak of finishing ds9 much like finishing next gen has be softened by a worthy successor still warming up to lt paris but i’m such a happy clam to have this universe to explore still,just finished ds9 six episodes into voyager
3917,startrek,spoilers for a recent ep of discodid anyone elses eyes roll back to their occipital lobe when after traveling 1000 years into the future where everything we see should be new and amazing and imaginative that like the 5th major character we meet is  drumroll  the main characters momfor me this is one of those amazing st gaffes like brain and brain uhuras st5 fan dance or the horrible khan yell in stid  not just a clunky moment but something that pulls me completely away from the show and makes me think what the heck is going on what are they thinking  im a fan from way back and root for trek and want it to do well  ive looked forward to new and interesting takes on st when tng and its successors were new when jj trek was coming and now cbs trek  but i cant shake the feeling that the creatives now in charge just dont know what theyre doing and dont have the imagination to tell new and interesting stories that scratch that st itch  the exception here is lower decks which despite a bit of obnoxiousness at the start has really developed into something with a lot of creativity and a unique voice i realize opinions may differ and thats fine but i really wonder:  when you saw mom pull back that cloak did that really work for youllap,mom recent discovery spoilers
3918,startrek,any of you guys remember star trek on the apple iigs  i had a free evening so i thought id do some gamingpics of the classic star trek on the iigs   even has original character voices  sound effects music the works  the iigs has the following specsrom 034mb ram expansion bringing total ram to 5mbae conserver cooling fan/floppy drive holder-  another rare thing to have these days  transwarp gs 7mhz accelerator-  very rare hard to find accelerator that makes the iigs a screaming demon  compact flash adapter 3000  a modern cf hard drive solution with usb interface that allows you to load disk images onto the machine with a user friendly menuuthernet ii-  apple iigs ethernet card for irc ftp bbsing  file sharing the worksdarksound gs  a modern stereo sound card for the iigs   the iigs had built in stereo sound  but to get stereo output you needed a breakout card  bose roomates apple branded speakers stereo speakers  these things kick,sunday night fun- playing star trek on my apple iigs system
3919,startrek,at one point the borg try building a communication device outside the enterprise to contact reinforcements if this is so couldnt they have done the time tunnel vortex thing in their region of space and launched a huge invasion force toward earth without any of the trouble of getting close to earth in the first place,is this a plot hole in first contact
3920,startrek,after kirk died in generations picard buried him on the planet  i thought this was odd especially since 3 federation starships arrived shortly after    i would think his body would have been taken home to earth or given a space burial similar to spocks in wrath of khan   he was deserving of a heros funeralthe only justification is that if picard did not think he was going to be shortly rescued but i dont think that was the case,kirks burial by picard in generations
3921,startrek,**spoiler alert:** the material below spoils character information revealed in the first half-dozen episodes of *star trek: discovery* season 3if you’ve not watched these episodes intend to do so and don’t want to be spoiled don’t read further in to this post&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 **micheal burnham and cleveland booker**   a black man booker and black woman burnham and not one of the   problems or challenges they face as people or as a couple is   because they are black   just as important: there is no hint that their phenotypes could be   the cause of a problem or challenge it doesn’t hurt that neither   ‘book’ nor burnham have so far been saddled with any ‘blackness   as character marker’ tropes at least so far as my not-american and   english-is-not-my-first-languge head has spotted   want me to believe in a-little-bit-utopian imagined star trek   future this is absolutely one of the necessary things for me   because without black people and not-white people in general   living as ‘just people’ being utterly normal i’m not going to buy   your imagined better future   futures made up only of people who all look   northern-european–descended aren’t utopias they are the aftermaths   of genocide   put another away sf has to normalise black people and not-white   people more generally living as unhyphenated humans black people   not being defined as ‘african-american people’ or as ‘black   people’ rather they are ‘people’ living with the same   opportunities and the same constraints and the same hopes and   the same fears as every other person   this is not the same thing as so-called ‘colour-blind’ writing   which tends to turn everyone in to ‘generic white’   differences don’t go away they just stop acting as limitations or   barriers or character markers   that latter point is a big one btw ‘sassy black woman’ for   example is not a character marker it’s a racist trope that hides   the trauma and exhausted and constant defence of self underlying   the actual behaviours the trope appropriates2 **adira tal** and **gray tal**   a woman adira and a man gray in a mixed-gender queer   relationship and the mixed-gender aspect isn’t used to argue the   pair are ‘actually’ or ‘basically’ straight   bisexual folk make up about 50% of all gsm folk and about 80% of   bisexual people are in mixed-gender relationships   my own bisexual-centric friends-and-family circle has a higher   percentage of bisexual-folk in same-gender relationships than the   world-wide average but there are still multiple mixed-gender queer   relationships in my circle and their being mixed-gender doesn’t   make them less queer   a *lot* of queer relationships are mixed-gender but narratives   that manage to acknowledge this let alone actively show this are   not exactly common   so even though this particular relationship is full of sfnal   tropery gray isn’t human; and now he’s dead and only visible to   adira i’ll take this one as a start better than nothing because   nothing is all-too-often the only alternative on offer   it helps that both of them are cute as hell and manage to show   ‘young love’ without being over-the-top with the adolescent drama   not because over-the-top adolescent drama is a bad thing per se   but because it makes this particular representation all the more   positive and delightful to watch,two relationships i particularly like in *star trek: discovery* season 3
3922,startrek,i always liked this one: q: how many ears does captain kirk havea: 3 the left ear the right ear and the final front ear,what are your favorite bad trek jokes nothing too mean or degrading to cast members
3923,startrek,,i love this speech
3924,startrek,is there some reason that they cant replicate this technology in the future why do they not have all future starships retrofitted,spore drive question
3925,startrek,,there are 791 episodes of star trek altogether and counting you could start a tradition of watching one episode of star trek every sunday night and it would sustain you for over 15 years
3926,startrek,,when an unauthorized officer is in your captains chair but theyre too cute to remove now i know how picard felt with handling wesley🤣🤣🤣🖖
3927,startrek,# preface:i love love love ds9 as it was written and produced these thoughts are not meant to disparage the show at all; its simply musings about what else could have beenavery brooks played a great commander and captain the nuance he brought to the character was amazingi am well aware that cmdr riker wanted the enterprise i also feel that of all the characters on tng his character development was done the least-- not to say it wasnt done at all but i think his character would have really blossomed on ds9 with that well begin the musings:# rikers charisma and back-alley personafor the developments that did happen with cmdr riker we got to see just slight glimpses of the wheeling-and-dealing that he could do we also got to witness how intimidating he can get on a few different occasions weve also seen how he had rapport with quark hes also shown how he can play dirty-- and this would have all been effective at ds9cmdr sisko embodies a lot of those qualities especially later on and i think cmdr riker being driven to some desperation would have been a great evolution of his character i could absolutely see riker truly losing it and saying major shut that thing off as an example riker needing to tap into that side of his would have been instrumental during the dominion war and he would have had ample time to consider or regret what he was becoming# getting cmdr riker to relinquish the enterprise via writingas i had mentioned in the preface cmdr riker was adamant about having command of the enterprise it was a taste that was difficult to dismiss when he had command on a few occasions particularly when they engaged the borg so the opening of deep space nine would have needed to have the wormhole already recently discovered by the time the first episode lands and the outpost seeking a capable commander enter william t riker# the enticing dynamics between riker and the other ds9 charactersi think the only real dynamic that may be sacrificed in this scenario is the one between jadzia and benjamin one of my favorite utterances throughout ds9 is the use of old man outside of that i could absolutely see riker and every character aboard ds9 having a great dynamic and still be very similar to how siskos dynamics worked out many ideas pop into mind here# the arrival of worfi could imagine how much the trek fandom freaked out when worf returned to star trek i wasnt connected with them at the time but seeing him appear made me scream out of excitement as a kid i think the dynamic between riker and worf was already fantastic besides you look good in a dress the further deepening of the dynamic would have been great for both of themi can think of many other points but ill save them from this already huge wall of text ill let you all ponder it too,i wonder often about what would have happened if cmdr riker was written to command ds9: some sunday musings
3928,startrek,,how long of a star trek drought will we have after discovery ends early january
3929,startrek,really any 24th century ships like nova intrepid miranda constellation i cant find any that have either enough quality to read or ones with enough detail to flesh out a shipthanks in advance,does anyone know where i can get good quality in depth high res deck plans
3930,startrek,its so about michael its every freaking story and every thing is about her i get shes is the main character but come on i actually like the character but its way too much starteak michael,discovery why is it even called star trek
3931,startrek,and to add to that uss cause i never knew what both of them meant,what does ncc stand for
3932,startrek,so with the trill the hosts almost seem like a serf race entirely dedicated to serving the symbionts - the hosts have joining as their ultimate purpose the ultimate sort of fulfillment they can achieve and many of them dedicate themselves entirely to receiving a symbionts but theres so many more hosts than symbionts that you end up with scores of people who spent decades planning to be joined only to be denied sometimes for seemingly arbitrary reasonsi mean we had an entire episode in ds9 where a trill held the crew hostage because he had spent his entire life hoping to be joined only to have his expectations dashed and simply didnt know what else to do the selection process doesnt seem good either; in the episode with jadzia and her initiate sisko goes so far as to call curzon abusive with initiates - he had a reputation for crushing potential hostsits an inherent imbalance - you have \*masses\* of people striving for an opportunity which there simply isnt enough of to sate them all but worse still their culture revolves around that opportunity they are cruel and harsh to people who seek it out and the vast majority of people who try and work for it have their dreams dashed to pieces - to say nothing of the fact that the hosts just seem to serve as a subservient caretaker race in general,trill power dynamics seem predatory to say the least
3933,startrek,which episode is the one in the tos that a space ship phases through universes and kirk gets caught im the ship,which episode
3934,startrek,silly stupid cringey and insufferable esp voyagers fairhaven imho of course,holodeck episodes are the worst
3935,startrek,i have been introducing my 12yo son to tos and he is loving it it will be time soon to move to tng and i am nervous in my opinion it took tng a few seasons to really find its footing and get good and i am worried that if we start season 1 then it will put him off the show where should i start him at,where to start with tng
3936,startrek,i count all post enterprise in this i enjoy the fact that they can actually show advanced looking technology that isnt just a box with lights on it or tubes that flash red things like the transporter arches in picard or the quantum storage also from picard,what do you enjoy about new trek
3937,startrek,,star trek: the next generation - season 6 is 31% off
3938,startrek,im currently watching through next gen and in season 3 episode 21 there is mention of the enterprise performing a saucer seperation and i was excited to see what would happen but the circumstances obviously mellowed out and it was no longer a necessary procedure i googled it and apperently the enterprise undergoes saucer separation a few times in the manga im wondering if there is any saucer separation in the actual shows ever also i just find it a cool concept that i never thought of the star ship doing before,saucer separation
3939,startrek,i was curious how many of the current discovery cast had worked on a trek television production in the past or been credited so i did some digging unsurprisingly the overlap is slight due to most of these series being over 20 years old but heres our current list of trek vets:**full list with credited role on discovery:**|*name*|*discovery role*|*prior series*||:-|:-|:-||jonathan frakes|director|tngds9voyent||gene roddenberry|series writing|tngds9voyent||david takemura|visual effects coordinator|tngds9voyent||joe menosky|co-executive producer|tngds9voy||ashley harvey|dialogue editor|ds9voyent||clint howard|actor|ds9ent||april nocifora|producer|ds9voy||john eaves|concept artist|ds9ent||paul lynch|adr recordist|tngds9||kevin quattro|viz effects supervisor 1 ep|ds9voy||bryan fuller|executive consultant|ds9voy||david barrett|director|ent||vaun wilmott|writing 2 episodes|tng||james duff|writing 1 episode|ent||tasia valenza|voice acting|tng||vaun wilmott|co-executive producer|tng||karen iverson|makeup department head|ds9||mark desimone|adr mixer|voy||michael van fleet|sr visual effects engineer|tng||pierre drolet|3d modeller 2 episoes|ent||alex daniels|utility stunts 1 episode|tng||alexander courage|composer original st theme|tng|,full list of discovery cast/crew with previous star trek television production experience
3940,startrek,and this list includes gene roddenberrythis is definitely far fewer collaborations than tng/ds9/voy since they had a lot of production overlap but i was surprised to see just how short the list washeres the full list of discovery credited cast/crew which worked on any tng-present productionsource: pulled the list from imdbs full cast + crew and mashed it together in libreoffice calc,of the nearly 2000 credited members of discoverys cast and crew only 22 have been credited to another live action star trek tv show tng-present
3941,startrek,im on a first time watch of voyager and man oh man does this show almost nail it for me i love the sense of blind exploration with a purpose as i approach season 3 some of the characters begin giving up and start to accept that voyager is life and they should let go of their old lives somehow episodically it just doesnt resonate with me though the bad episodes are really bad and the good episodes are only good not great i find myself dreaming up what ifs with the premise more than focusing on what is going on in the actual show it seems like this idea was done better with bsg in later yearsmy question to the group is should i keep going or should i pull up a list of essential voyager episodes and just peel through those to get to enterprise im about to skip the last 3 episodes of season 3 and get to season 4 seven of nine intro and ive heard thats when the show gets noticeably better,voyager recommendations
3942,startrek,so adira is 16 and has some sort of very serious relationship with someone to the extent they have memories of years together when did this relationship start it just feels incredibly weird and to be honest inappropriate that we have an underage person in such a relationship,its not just me that finds this weird right
3943,startrek,there have been many posts lamenting the lack of character development for bryce nilsson owo rhys and detmer particularly given the fact that ronnie rowe jr sara mitich oyin oladejo patrick kwok-choon and emily coutts are all fine actors  so lets crowdsource it  i propose that each response to the main thread tackle one of these characters and then it can become our head canon until such time as it is contradicted on screen  here are the questions im suggesting:  1 full name and rank  2 major at the academy  3 any nickname and the story behind it  4 hobbies  5 favourite book movie holo  6 random special skill and the story behind it  7 favourite place in the universe  8 special people in their lives  9 secret crush  10 best way to spend shore leave  ill get the ball rolling with linus as an example,crowdsourcing the backstories for bryce nilsson owo rhys and detmer
3944,startrek,theres no introductory series something that annoyed me about tng that in retrospect was very smart is that roddenberry made it so there were only limited references to the original series just enough to establish that they are in the same universe but not enough for you to need to have watched tos to understand tng this annoyed me because i wanted to know more about the galactic barrier the guardian of forever  the organians etc but it was the best to introduce younger fans to whom the 60s show was too passe this is not the case for the modern shows discovery picard and especially lower decks assume youve watched the previous tv shows or are at least familiar with the world its an issue because this era of star trek doesnt stand on its own i could argue that season 3 of discovery is the first season of any show that could apparently stand on its own but the more it goes on the more it seems that you would need to at least watch season 2 to fully get whats going on the season that assumed that youve watched the menagerie and that you are familiar with spock and to a lesser extent captain pike,a real issue with modern star trek that no one brings up

3951,startrek,it feels like the writers are explicitly making burnam unbearable the crying soliloquies and warped sense of entitlement the character is dripping with makes it nearly impossible to like her it’s as though someone say there and wants to make her a martyr for a cause that’s never been truly defined and making her be as though she was a major influence on another well established character is frankly bullshitif they need to give her constant soliloquies to show she’s the centre of the show they’re not doing it right shakespeare used them less,why do the disco writers insist on crying and soliloquies
3952,startrek,so on deep space nine captain sisko made a light sail and managed to go faster than the speed of light how did he do that without a warp bubble or anything to protect them from particles tearing up the ship you cant travel faster than the speed of light so i got confused lol i know the ships they have just warp space around them and have some special technology to shield them from the effects of tiny wimy stuff,question about light sail that sisko made
3953,startrek,ive been taking my so through enterprise for the first time i hadnt watched it in a few years and we arrived at the episode future tense briefly the enterprise discovers a ship from more than 900 years in the future derelict in space approx 100 years prior to the events of disco season 3 the episode got me thinking about discospoilers for the enterprise episode if anyone hasnt watched itwhat we see of the ship and obviously its just one ship makes me question the premise of discos season 3 more than i already have been if the ship had any semblance of a warp core or dilithium trip and company would have easily identified it and not been mystified with the ships various components both organic and otherwise since the basic components of a warp engine wouldnt be dissimilar from that of enterprises the ship and its construction also demonstrated a mastery of spatial geometry and folded dimensions within a compact space a la the tardis in doctor who this suggests technology far beyond that of what weve seen in disco season 3and yes im aware of the argument that the burn set technology back because of its destructive power but its not as if the burn actively eradicated entire civilisations the technology and power utilisation we see in future tense is completely alien to the crew of the enterprise even if the sole occupant of the ship is a human with a bunch of other genetic bits mixed in and yes im also aware of the argument that the ban on time travel technology might mean the end of using anything remotely close to time travel but that doesnt negate the use of something beyond just matter antimatter and dilithium to power a ship and of course what we dont know about the details of that ship could fill a universe in itself as well as the time between that vehicles commission 900 years in the future so the ships actual home year would be 900 + x and the events of disco season 3 but the disconnect in technological utilisation is disconcerting on a logical level clearly the 31st century had great understandings of both space and time and quantum physics as an extension so why in the world would they still be using standard warp drive,enterprises episode future tense and disco season 3
3954,startrek,were looking for some christmas gifts for a relative he likes star trek and says he enjoyed  painting all the little details and windows on some sort of insanely complex enterprise d model were looking for self-assemble self-paint models of similar quality size and complexity i think he already has most of the enterprise models as well as the reliant and and maybe the defiantwe found this model of the discovery but its not clear to me whether its a diy kitthis klingon battle cruiser does seem to be an actual kit although i think this specific ship was only on screen for a few minutes in the motion picture so im not sure whether it would be the the best pick for a trek fan does anyone have any favorite model kits they might recommend,nice model kits to gift a trek fan
3955,startrek,every ten minutes there is some ponderously emotional moment someone looks at someone else with glistening eyes and we as viewers are supposed to feel how momentous it isthe problem is that when there are 5-10 such moments in each episode they very quickly completely lose their effect at this point it just feels tiresome and cheesywhen you add the almost equally frequent comedic banter and quips it makes the needle swing around the emotional compass like crazy the constant and inconsistent emotional overload makes the whole show messy and unaffecting,i dont like how saccharine discovery is
3956,startrek,ok i love star trek it is so dear to me but over the years of many rewatches of all episodes mostly ds9 i eventually got a strong dislike and almost cringe every time i see and especially hear deanna trol i dont know how it happened but it did as when i fist saw tng i liked her and certain other people annoyed me that dont anymore but it seems like i eventually got a huge dislike for troi amd its definitely not going to go away i cannot stand her stupid dam accent its so cringe to me why even give her a fucking accent anyway where is she from do we even hear her speak her native language obviously english isnt her first language and then her hair when she walks how it bounces i know its stupid and finally: captain i sense much deception in him no fucking shit deanna hes a romulan deception hmmmm thanks captain i sense danger 1 second later worf captain sheilds down to 20% once again thanks deanna your dam senses are pretty fucking helpful keep up the good work   anyway my rant is done im expecting downvotes because i know pretty much everyone loves her  i think but i just had to get this out and take a karma hit just hopefully some people could understand or agree with me on some things good day my friends,deanna accent and probably downvotes go for it

3959,startrek,in star trek the federation is kind of a utopia  but go outside of federation space and the rest of galaxy is pretty much under the thumb of one authoritarian regime or another  here is how i would end tyranny in star trek  1 i would find the plans for as many federation and alien warships as i could  i would reverse engineer them and come up with new ship designs based on their technology  but not exactly the same ship  that way the federation and the other factions dont hunt me down  i would also reverse engineer romulan cloaking technology  so that civilians could build their own cloaked warships2 i would design holograms and robots specifically for ship building  so you would have a cheap labor force who could build ships way better then humans can3 i would release the plans for the new warships on subspace to anyone who wants them  and include holograms that can help with ship design and construction4  i would watch as civilians build warships and take back their planets from oppressive regimes  can you imagine civilians flying around in something the equivalent of a defiant or galaxy class ship   or even better the scimitar from nemisis  considering that most materials used in ship construction can be replicated the only real limitation to how many ships you could build would be energy  and that is pretty abundant in space  with a lot of civilians now owning their own warships establishing a dictatorship would be near impossible  so that would level the playing fieldso that is how i would end oppression in star trek  it worked pretty well for the terran resistance  mirror obrian stole the plans for the defiant and built another one  and used it to defeat the alliance  i say give everyone the information they need to build their own warships and the galaxy would be a much freer place  let me know what you think in the comments,how i would end tyranny in star trek

3962,startrek,first i will say i have much love and admiration for all the engineers we have seen in trek there isnt a one who doesnt inspire at least a little awe when it comes to their technical expertise but there is one that sails head and shoulders above the rest and that is geordi laforge allow me to explain:1 he is a graduate of starfleet academy and the corps of engineers geordi comes to us a fresh faced lieutenant junior grade assigned to the federation flagship this we all know is no easy task and we learn later this is because he impressed captain picard years earlier as an ensign with his tenacity and ingenuity fixing a problem so right away we know he is trained and he has mad skills 2 geordi takes over engineering in one year he goes from piloting the ship to in charge of the whole engineering department his work is so impressive that we watch him get not one but two promotions from lieutenant to lt cmdr and ultimately commander all in seven years this is a pace unheard of and unseen anywhere else in trek geordi is so skilled they cant help but promote him over and over 3 geordi is one of a very select few people who understands and can work on positronics this is shown throughout his entire working relationship with data when maddox first attempts to get his hands on data for study data quits starfleet rather than submit to any testing this is a hesitancy he never shows with geordi proving geordi has a better working knowledge and obviously the trust of data to do the work geordi helps data install his emotion chip geordi helps with datas dream program geordi helps program b4  countless times geordi is tasked with understanding what is going on with data and finding ways to fix him or bring him back up to snuff no one else ever shows that level of knowledge or comfortability 4 there is no technology geordi ever encounters that he cannot understand or make work as chief engineer of the federation flagship we know the crew comes into contact with more alien species than any other countless times geordis skills are utilized to make the alien technology work or make starfleet tech work better from the pakleds the iconians the aldeans the borg cytherians romulans klingons etca whole host of technologies encountered by the enterprise and dependent on laforges ability to understand it and make it work or understand it and overcome/overpower it 5 geordi knows more than scotty now before you all start screaming please pay attention: scotty is a great engineer and we have seen him pull off incredible feats but those were almost exclusively based off federation technology only rarely was he required to actually work with or understand alien tech in most cases anything alien was treated as hostile and scottys job was simply to overpower/destroy it this does not require investigating beyond what something is made of and if the phasers can blast through it scotty was great at saving the enterprise and making its systems function but he was bad when it came to alien tech he didnt show much range with it until much later in his career by virtue of just being born and trained later geordi knows more he is the most qualified engineer that we have seen to date all others are his contemporaries so their knowledge base would be essentially the same not to mention that when scotty and geordi did work together geordi was able to put his knowledge to work and quickly often outpacing scotty and making him nostalgic for his glory days again scotty is a great engineer but geordi will always have this leg up on him in this regard 6 geordi taught miles obrien everything he knows keep in mind obrien was apart of geordis staff on the enterprise for at least 6 years that meant it was geordis job to train him and hone his skills which he did ably otherwise obrien never would have been promoted to chief and made it to ds9 also as an actual officer geordis training would have been way more intensive and extensive there putting him above obrien we know that obrien goes on to be a great engineer but he definitely owes alot of his career success to working with geordi on the enterprise in conclusion there is no more talented versatile innovative or overly qualified engineer we ever see in starfleet to date geordis ability to work with anyone and anything makes him uniquely suited to be in deep space and obviously in charge of engineering on the federation flagship he is a dedicated scientist and researcher investigator and determined to make sure his department is always performing at its best there is no other engineer we ever watch who surpasses his skill set though they each have qualities that still make them great in their own right but geordi laforge is the best and this is the hill i will die on,the hill i will die on geordi laforge is the best engineer

3964,startrek,but its a big onei was really psyched for a new trek series with a decent budget and contemporary story telling techniquesdone right a good trek series could rival game of thrones in my opinionthen came the news it was to be prequel first mistake we all knew there was no way this could be shoe horned comfortably into cabin and we were rightthen came the 1st season - and heres the problem - theres little to no thought put into why things are some examples; why are the uniforms different why do they have holographic communications why did spock never mention micheal why does the turbo lift behave like a roller-coaster why the spore drive why is the bridge so massivethe answer to all of the above is; someone thought they looked cool beyond that theres no practical or logical explanation theres no thinking in discovery its all bells and whistles and no substancethe third season is a slight improvement but still it really needs to start thinking about why,just one of the things that really bugs me about disco

3970,startrek,come with me my nerd friends and think about a lone episodes of voyager named memory alpha in this episode we find a copy of the doctor blah blah blah he saves the day my point is the doctor has a copy floating around space that i believe i read was 700 years after voyager in pure fan theory is it possible he’s around with discovery let’s ignore the fact his actor appearing on the show is unlikely and would be as people in real life do aged could he be this is what i think about while trying to sleep,memory alpha and discovery
3971,startrek,his workout holodeck training was only featured a few times on tng and it was intense because he almost killed riker until riker shouted him out of the delusion of battle and why can we not have that kind of program can’t a trainer dress like worf along with a few more personal trainers dress like monsters and have this workout somewhere a special klingon gym club,how far could you make it in lt worf’s calisthenics holodeck program

3977,startrek,watching ds9 and dax says a klingon word to sisko who turns to worf to translate this is obviously all for drama because this assumes the com badge would somehow know they intend to use the alien word as the alien word an not translate itbends my mind a little,it’s a show no need to take it seriously but after years of watching star trek i just had this question occur to me: how the heck does the translator know when to not translate words
3978,startrek,the melody is not identical but its very similar  copyright claim,did outlander rip off its theme music from inner light
3979,startrek,i personally like the original tos era bridge better i think it conveyed that idea of the future but not sleek the ship itself and the shape i like better than tos the tos enterprise looked kinda flimsy and breakable the characters are okay i like the idea of children being introduced but not the idea of telepaths the music and soundtrack are good because they integrate some aspects of the original theme the cgi has really improved since the 60s so thats good the storylines and ideas are kinda similar to tos so thats okay not stellar im not a big fan of picards emotions towards kids sorry for the rant,beginner trekkie here just watched the first episode of tng part 1&amp;2 here is what i like about it and what i dont
3980,startrek,,no matter how hard i try i can’t get interested in discovery it just seems so generic to me i only watch the fan service episodes does anyone else share this feeling
3981,startrek,what if the maquis had actually defeated the cardassians  how would that have changed the alpha quadrant  i think the way the federation and especially sisko treated the maquis was pretty awful  so how would things have changed if the maquis had won  let me know what you think,what if the maquis had won
3982,startrek,,why doesn’t cbs make a star trek show with all the complex plot lines of discovery but use the simple 60s aestethic of the original series i’m sure it would get great fan reception so why hasn’t it been done yet
3983,startrek,not to start a full discussion on star trek discovery plot but we’ve seen a lot of different captains over the years now from war poets to brawling tacticians and i’m sure everyone here has their favorite i liked the change he brought by being truly ruthless &amp; embracing evil to achieve ones goals that for him the goal justifies the means a stark contrast to most idealistic captains we’ve had before i’m not saying he is perfect but it made an interesting change to what we are used to i was disappointed that they had to switch him as we could have seen an interesting character arc about redemption embrace or perhaps the toil of war we like to think of the federation as our futuristic utopian vision of humanity but with lorca one could discover more of the dark &amp; covert sides of the star fleet &amp; in turn humanity,i actually like gabriel lorca &amp; wish we could discover more of his character arc

3986,startrek,this is re-posted after the original title was deemed to specific and spoiler-y sorry for before i thought i was vague enough hopefully this new title is good but if not i wont try to re-post it again i was surprised to see how hated surus decision was too i expected it to be pretty controversial now that youve accepted the consequences of clicking on a spoiler tag for the latest episode ill elaborate fullya lot of people are angry about tillys promotion to temporary first officer and there are certainly reasons to be skeptical however everyone seems to be focused on the massive rank jump i sorta agree here but given all tilly has been through i dont think its unreasonable in that kinda never in the real world but its ok for a show kinda way the same way ensign crusher lt nog and maybe even a good chunk of the maquis in voyager are finemy problem is that suru just made the same mistake he made with burnham let me explainlast episode or was it 2 episodes ago i dont remember suru demoted michel for all the right reasons but importantly he said something to the effect of in youre defense i cannot place all the blame on you you were very vocal on your indifference and reservation to the assignment yet i insisted he then goes on about how he did so to keep some sense of familiarity or something like that but thats less important its this very defense that convinced me she didnt deserve to be dismissed from starfleet altogetherthen enters ensign tilly i dont doubt an ensign could be a good first officer nor do i doubt tilly could be a great #1 or even captain one day however one of the first things tilly says when offered the position is paraphrasing but sir im an ensign i would be in charge of ***lives***\*\*\*\* ive never been in a command position of any kind before one of the first things tilly does is express serious concern for her ability to cope with the pressure and weight of the responsibility in a crisis and rightfully so even a skilled officer would feel the weight of that if they saw it coming this is probably a large part of why suru gives her a day to thinkhowever its worth noting that tilly herself doesnt seem to think she is ready and more then anybody she should know how she would react under that kind of stress right now but does she decide she is ready does she go ok that was sudden and caught me off guard but i can do this no she only accepts after all her friends tell her without hearing her out take the job basically peer pressuring her into it to me in that scene she always looked concerned and unready for the responsibility until the sr-18 data distracted herdiscovery isnt the cerritos either if it were just some ship i would let it slide discovery is the single most important starship in the entire known galaxy it is reserved specifically to jump immediately into only the most desperate hostile and critical situations as explicitly layed out by the admiral tilly doesnt have the luxury of trying the seat out taking it easy on some trial missions and deferring to suru if need be she will almost certainly be directly responsible for not just the lives of her crew but the spore drive and by extension the future of the entire federation itself and she doesnt think shes ready for itsuru has again chosen someone how does not think they are right for the job again through a sense of familiarity do you know what a good solution would be getting a permanent replacement now from the admiral instead of doing it latter heck even picking a permanent #1 from discoverys own crew now or even a temporary one from the admiral i should really learn his name someone confident with experience and reliableeven narratively it feels like they are setting up for a tilly isnt ready and gets people killed episode to me logically this seems makes sense tooif you support surus decision i would love to hear a solid defense to this argument i want to like everything about all the shows i watch that would just make them better after all and fan communities are great at fixing little errors and problems like this,discovery 307: it isnt the experience that bothers me about that decision its the personnel involved
