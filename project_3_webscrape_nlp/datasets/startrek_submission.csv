One is a bit deeper than the others.

**Layer 1**

The quote from Julius Caesar: 

&gt;We at the height are ready to decline.


&gt;There is a tide in the affairs of men


&gt;Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;


&gt;Omitted, all the voyage of their life


&gt;Is bound in shallows and in miseries.


&gt;On such a full sea are we now afloat,


&gt;And we must take the current when it serves,


&gt;Or lose our ventures. (IV.ii.269–276)

[An excerpt of the explanation at literarydevices.net](https://literarydevices.net/there-is-a-tide-in-the-affairs-of-men/):

""In our lives, we get ebbs and flows; however, we sometimes are unable to recognize whether the tide is an opportunity or an obstacle. It is up to us to avail ourselves of an opportunity or a warning sign.""

&gt;!I read that as a reference to the lack of clarity around whether Osyraa's desire to negotiate is an opportunity or a warning sign and the lack of certainty on whether Vance and Osyraa will avail themselves of the opportunity/warning.!&lt;

**Layer 2**

&gt;!Read out loud, the title is ""There is a Tide DOT DOT DOT""

That's a reference to the 3 DOT23s that show up at the end of the episode to help the bridge officers.!&lt;

**Layer 3**

&gt;!DOT DOT DOT as in morse code which is featured heavily in the scene where the bridge officers take down the regulators.!&lt;

**Bonus Layer**

Note that when they first revealed the episode titles from this season, this episode was named 'The Good of the People'. That's probably a reference to a quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero:

&gt;Salus populi suprema lex esto

Which is popularly translated as:

&gt;""The good of the people is the greatest law."" 

*[Other translations of the latin, source and explanation here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salus_populi_suprema_lex_esto)*

&gt;!I personally read that as a reference to what is at stake in the negotiation. While Vance and Osyraa negotiate, they *should* be paying attention to the ""greatest law"" i.e. ""the good of the people"".!&lt;

Responding to a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/7aobgs/counselor_troi_useless/)

Clearly some fans may treat her as useless, and some are even more disparaging. Feminists at the time despised her, even the writers struggled to realise her usefulness but Troi is not just a pretty face, if there was a character usefulness tier list from Picard's perspective, Troi would probably be at the top. 

Troi, whilst functioning as a councillor has managed to resolve a number of serious internal and external conflicts, providing insights not only into the entire crews emotional states as a collective during crises but also some of the thoughts and deceptions of enemies standing on different ships. She was able to communicate the distress of Riva when he lost his trio. She was also instrumental at forewarning the Captain as to the nature and intent of several extremely high risk, deity level threats such as Nigilum (It's treating us like lab rats, leading Picard to self-destruct the ship) and Q's immense intellect (before the encounter proper), without them being aware of her doing so.  She also helped Doctor Pulaski saved Riker's life by sensing Riker's dreams, later on obtains command qualifications. She is not just a crewman, she is another sensor added to the ship that can detect emotional intelligence and looked at as a sensor she fundamentally  aligns with the goal ""to seek out new life and civilisations"" but as a crewmember who counsels others and has the captains ear, she links the aloof captain to his staff without him needing to be there at all times.

The Emerald chain being a capitalist conglomerate of Worlds rather then the Orion Syndicate knock off they seemed, is on the face of it an interesting turn of events. But they've left it so late in the day they've left themselves no time to explore it before they move onto the next thing. 


The following is a thought experiment on how I'd of laid the season out . 

TL;DR version If you don't care to read the rest:   First 4 episodes deal with Burnham and Discovery turning up in the 31st century and establish the status quo between the Federation and the Emerald chain. The middle 4 mix stand alone with tge serialised elements of Michael trying to solve the mystery of the Burn . The final 5 would resolve the mystery of the Burn and culminate with a rejigged version of Osyraas plan to gain an audience with the Admiral and make her proposal.  

Episode 1:
- We open with Micheal working for an organisation called the Emerald chain under Osyraa. 
- secretly she's trying to use its resources to find Discovery.
- episode will establishing the galactic Status quo generally and the chains perspective on the burn and the federations and its failures specifically.
- The episode would end with them arriving over a pre warp world the chains plans first contacts with only to find a Federation ship already in Orbit.  Red alert. 

Episode 2 :  
- Would see the Discovery crash land on said pre warp planet 24 hours before.
-  they Send out a sos on federation channels and race against time to repair and free the ship before the planets pre warp inhabitants reach them. 
- Episode ends with a Federation ship arriving in orbit.

Episode 3 : 
- Both ships lock weapons on eachother and demand to know what the other is doing there. The chain accuse the Federation of hypocrisy for attempting to contact a pre warp civilization after all their high minded rhetoric. 
- The Federation Captain accuses the Chain of only being their to exploit the world for its resources. Osyraa responds saying they don't exploit they strike deals, our tech for their resources.  Besides ,you don't get to dictate how we survive the scarcity you helped cause. 
- Sensing high technology on the surface , Osyraa transports Michael down to investigate with a security officer,  they reach Discovery,  the security guard is shocked to discover the crew know Michael,  she turns her weapon on him and takes him prisoner . 
- After a lot of hugging Saru tells Michael to go help stamets get the spore drive working . Back up in orbit the two captains play for time rattling their sabres . 
- The federations ships long range sensors are picking up a chain vessel on an intercept course, they inform Discovery its now or never. Saru calls for a Black Alert . Discovery rises, pulling itself free from the jungle undergrowth , at 200 feet it spore jumps . And appears right behind Osyraa's ship, ""interesting"" she mutters at a technology that could see  Discovery just appear without warning behind her. Outnumbered she orders her ship to warp away. The Federation captain  is holo projected onto the Discoveries Bridge , Welcome home Discovery.  

Episode 4: 
- Opens with a montage of the crew being debriefed and Michael being interrogated back at federation HQ. 
- Debrief complete Saru is called into Admiral Vances office. 
- They are being sent to Trill to reestablish contact . 
- A Trill first officer Lt cmdr Adira Tal is assigned as Discoveries First officer to give them someone with first hand knowledge of the 31st century and of Trill.
- Saru requests Michael,  the Admiral agrees and places Michael in Sarus custody . She is not trusted due to her previous affiliation with the Chain. 
They arrive on Trill and are surprised to be taken hostage. They are put in a holding cell and told to wait. 
-  Osyraa ship arrives in orbit and she transports down, she is greeted with full diplomatic honors not granted to their Federation Guests. 
- they inform Osyraa they have a gift for the Chain . Saru Michael and Adira are led into the room in cuffs . 
- so Kind but completely unnecessary,  release them . 
- Saru demands to know whats going on. What are the Chain doing on a Federation world.
- Thats just it , Captain you are no longer on a Federation world Trill is now a member of the Chain . 
- Saru looks at the Trill President,  while the federation retreated and licked their wounds after the burn, the Chain were there for us, their supplies staved off famine that would have killed millions,  for a modest fee interjects Osyraa, lower now you're a member of course . 
- are we free to go Saru asks , of course Osyraa answers.
- they leave and the episode ends .

Episode 5 : 
- TNG style Stand alone episode 
- Michael asks to be assigned to working on the Burn Data to combine what she already knows from the Chains Analysis. 

Episode 6 : 
- Tilly tries to Get Michael to open up about the year she spent as a member of the Chain. 
- we see Flashbacks of Michael arriving in the 31st century,  sending the suit back through the wormhole,  meeting Ossyra. 
- we see her reluctance to let go of her past life , to give up on the Federation,  but then she meets Book , a Chain Courier, and falls in love . 
-  Book had almost convinced her to leave the Chain with him when she detected  the wormhole similar to the one she came through. 

Episode 7 :
- more TNG style stand alone stuff 

Episode 8 : 
- a resource rich planet announces its ready to hear competing bids for its membership from  the federation and the Chain.
- both sides lay out their strengths and point out their opponents flaws.
- during a break in negotiations,  Tilly spots Osyraa and Michael talking in the corridor.
- before she can confront her or inform Saru negotiations resume. Things go back and forth before in a surprising turn of events Osyraa informs them they are withdrawing their bid. The question of why and what Osyraa and Michael were talking about is left hanging as the episode ends . 

Episode 9 :
- Owo and Detmar get trapped somehow and we find out more about them, why they decided to abandon all they knew to follow Michael through the wormhole. 
- Michael continues to work on the burn .
- episode ends with Micheal Discovering something important about the Burn . 

Episode 10 : 
- Michael and Stamets research leads them to believe the burn started in a particularly vicious Nebula.
- using the same technique as used in Suka'l they spore jump into a less stormy part of the nebula and transport down onto what appears to be the bridge of the Enterprise D 
- rather then a immature Kelpian they discover an elderly Q in ill fitting spandex arguing with himself , we hear Him mutter Jean Luc once or twice . 
- Q was imprisoned in the nebula over 800 years ago by the other members of the Q Continium because he was still too immature to move onto the next plane of existence. 
- the nebula dampens his powers explaining why he's aged .
- 200 years ago after 500 years of loneliness Q began to lose his mind the psychic shock waves of which caused the burn. 
- in the ready room they discuss their options, on the one hand pre imprisonment he was an agent of chaos, on the other hand if he has another psychic meltdown it could destabilise what little dilithium is left in the Alpha/beta Quadrants . They decide to break him out of his imprisonment .
- culber manages calm Q down and they transport up to the Discovery and make ready to Spore jump believing the mycelium network will allow them to breach the nebula with Q in tow.
- free from the nebula mental interference,  Q becomes more lucid and the consequences of his imprisonment and the burn, are laid out , really , I caused all that he asks. Dont worry I can fix this,  he snaps his fingers but nothing happens, with the continium gone so too went his powers, for the first time in his life he can't just snap his finger and undo his mistakes.  He is distraught.
- Culber informs him they are letting him go , there is nothing they could do that would punish him any more then he's doing himself. 
- Q leaves the ship promising to be a better man and earn the right to follow his brothers onto the next plane . 

Episode 11 
- Discovery receives a distress signal from Ossyra she claims she wants to defect and is being pursued by a chain ship. Discovery steps in and rescues her and they head back to HQ so Ossyra can be debriefed and talk to Admiral Vance . 
- when they get there Ossyra is slapped in cuffs and thrown in a cell . They don't believe her , yet. 
- The Admiral discusses their options , take what she has to say at face value or interrogate her .
- they opt for the latter , she is being led off to be interrogated when Michael energes from the shadows and stuns the guards . They sneak into Vances office taking him prisoner and locking the doors . 
- I knew I shouldn't  have trusted you (Vance to Michael) 
- episode ends 

Episode 12:

- last scene is recapped,  in her defence i have someone she loves(book was taken hostage as soon as Michael betrayed Ossyra in ep 1), so I wouldn't judge her too harshly . 
- she explains the reason for the subterfuge,  she wasn't defecting she is there to negotiate an armistice and merger between the Chain and Federation.
- as she explains it , we are a mercantile conglomerate dealing in lifes necessities , our trade network has kept hundreds of worlds economies afloat and preventing them from starving . For a price Vance retorts . Dilithium costs money Admiral, our Chains stability relies on our ability to fulfil our obligations and we are running low on Dilithium. Without more a hundred worlds will fall into chaos and starvation. Which brings me to my point , we are aware you have come into possession of a novel bit of technology that if replicated could open up the Galaxy again. We both have something the other wants Admiral , we represent 45% of the planets of your once mighty Federation , wouldn't you like them to return to the fold ? . Share the technology with us and we will forge our future together.  Vance tells her they still haven't been able to replicate the tech , let us help ossyra replies . You've given me food for thought , let me take what you've said to my superiors.  I'm trusting you Admiral ,Ossyra nods to Michael and puts her hands over her head, Michael presses a button and unlocks the door and a stream of security guards rush  in . 
-all the above would be interspersed with Discovery crew reacting to Michael's betrayal and Federation security trying to break into the office . 
-Episode ends 

Episode 13: 

-last scene recap Vance tells them its OK and to take them back to the ambassadorial quarters for now. 
- Saru it told to wait outside Vances office while he confers with the federation council on the Chains offer. 
- he emerges looking drawn . He explains the situation to Saru , the council are tentatively agreeing to the proposal,  but with a few changes , and I don't think they're going to like them . 
- in the Ambassadorial quarters , Ossyra tells Michael she doesn't blame her for her betrayal from ep 1 , we do anything for the ones we love. What do you know about love Michael retorts , I love the chain My dear the needs of its many outweigh the needs of the one or on occasion... hundred. 
- vance calls them to his office , the federation council has provisionally agreed to your proposal on one condition , you hand yourself over to be judged in a court of law for your crimes on Miranda 3 .
-ossyra is shocked and disgusted, part of the proposal was amnesty for all, what you call a massacre I call a trade dispute.  Michael drags her to a corner and reminds her what she said about Loving the chain and the needs of the many . 
- she returns to the table. Its a deal breaker for your people?, it is Vance replies . She looks back over to Burnham,  then I agree to your terms . 
- Michael meets Ossyra in the shuttle bay where she is to be taken to a penal colony to await trial. 
- Michael promises to be a character witness . 
- season ends with the first chain ship ever to dock at federation HQ , they are there escorting the Chains greatest scientific minds to help with unlocking the secret to replicating the spore drive . 
- it is a happy optimistic note to end on , only lifted more when Book is the last person down the gangway , Burnham rushes into his arms

If this is the only thing you get from this post, make it this: taste politics are stupid. There is nothing wrong with enjoying or even loving media that isn't good. But enjoying something doesn't make it good, either.

It's been interesting to see the revisionist takes on ENT crop up over the years, and it seems worsened by the new era of Trek. I don't know what show some of you were watching the way some of you praise ENT.

Again, no one is on blast for enjoying it. But people trying to now argue that it's actually good? C'mon. Those are some nostalgia-induced revisions, and reactionary in nature. I get it. The current spat of Trek shows are polarizing. Disco season 3 really won me over, and Lower Decks was delightfully amusing, but the rest is pretty awful. But just because Picard is mind bogglingly stupid doesn't make ENT good. And just because watching ENT is connected to a special time in your life doesn't make it a good show, either. 

I guess all of this begs the question: what makes for a good show? Obviously there isn't a single answer for this, because every show is unique. Instead we can analyze how well it achieved its goals, as well as comparing its practices to relevant conventions in TV.

And in that regard, it's maybe mediocre overall. There are some good episodes, but there's a lot of rehashed Star Trek plots in there too. It made Star Trek feel narrow and limited. ""We need to have an episode about a transporter malfunction because this is what Trek does.""

2. How he was quick to volunteer to be a host body so the ambassador could carry out peace negotiations. 

3. His attitude when Picard chooses Data's suggestions over Riker's. He understood that it wasn't about ego, but what was in the best interest for the crew (even though it sent them in a time loop and it turned out his suggestion would have worked. Oh the details)

But I feel that's an outdated and misapplied trope that only applies to TOS and early TNG.

So, because I have nothing better to do on this chilly January COVID Saturday, with the assistance of Memory Alpha I'm going to evaluate every Starfleet Commodore, Rear Admiral, Admiral, and Fleet Admiral that's appeared on screen to determine if they truly are bad.

##Evaluation

I am leaving out flag officers that were only seen impersonated (e.g. Admiral Bullock by Species 8472), under the unwilling control of another force (Vice Admiral Aaron by the brain slugs), spies or moles (Commodore Oh is a Romulan Zhat Vash General) or merely mentioned with no affect on the story.

I am also only considering a character's actions while they held the rank of Admiral and ignoring what they did before attaining the rank (Captain Pressman's command of the Pegasus) or after retiring (Norah Satie's investigation).

Alternate reality versions of these flag officers that have no impact on the main timeline are ignored. I am including the Kelvin films, though.

Characters that appear as Admirals in multiple shows/films (Nechayev) will only be counted in one.

They will all be held to the expectations of that rank.

##Enterprise

##Conclusion

Among Star Trek on TV, as expected TOS and TNG led the pack with badmirals, largely in the form of corrupt or inept flag officers. I was surprised by DS9's high score, though the Admiral representation in that series is dominated by Ross, and the two bad ones still believed that they were doing the right thing for the right reasons.

This evaluation did not weight any Admiral's score with their importance to the story, and a quick perusal will find that any time an Admiral is a focus of a single episode they'll probably be bad, but if they're just giving orders over a screen they're usually okay, but possibly disconnected from the reality out in the field. If an Admiral shows up more than once they're almost certain to be good, even if they may occasionally be bad for a good cause.

Our favorite Captains also tend to make poor flag officers. They belong in a chair out exploring the stars.

I think season one is pretty great, and  I think 'The Storyteller' is a great example why. The plot with the paqu and Navut is pretty standard Trek fare and isn't the most inspired- but the exploration of Jake and Nog's friendship is great and charming and some of it is genuinely hilarious. Nog's awkwardness (saying 'great idea' when they offer to show Varis the wormhole) fleshes out some of his character, and the father and son relationship between Sisko and Jake is enjoyable. The episode is full of little touches of characterization that make me laugh; Sisko pulling Jake back when he's about to kiss Varis, Kira saying 'at least we all agree on something' and awkwardly smiling. The plot with O'Brien and Bashir is also great, and lays the groundwork for their future friendship. I think this episode exemplifies why I love Deep Space Nine and its first season especially. The characterization is just amazing, and the plots that are decried as 'slow' and 'boring' give the actors time to show their characters. Season one might not be the best season of Deep Space Nine, but it's my favorite because of episodes like this.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272516,public,self,The storyteller,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kp7wl3/the_storyteller/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They should have rules against getting involved in primitive civilizations.  But those rules should be flexible and there should be exceptions.  Especially for preventing planetary disasters.  They should also have rules against time travel.  But they should be flexible too and time travel should be allowed especially to stop galaxy wide disasters.

And what would they do if there was an even better utopia right next door.  They would either have to change or watch as their member worlds left to join the new and better utopia.

I'll admit to being surprised by quite a few of the scores from Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates multiple reviews into a single average score.

Ordering best to worst, according to an average of critical reviews, the franchise looks something like this:

**Television**

1. TAS: 94%
2. DS9: 90%
3. TNG: 89%
4. PIC: 87%
5. DSC: 85%
6. TOS: 80%
7. VOY: 77%
8. LDS: 65%
9. ENT: 57%

**Film**

1. ST09: 94%
2. FC: 92%
3. TWOK: 88%
4. BEY: 86%
5. ID: 84%
6. TUC: 82%
7. TVH: 81%
8. TSFS: 79%
9. GEN: 48%
10. INS: 54%
11. TMP: 41%
12. NEM: 38%
13. TFF: 21%

Right off the bat there's a massive difference between fan perception and general perception - Star Trek 09 is the best received Star Trek film, beating out First Contact AND Wrath of Khan.

I'm also quite surprised to see The Animated Series come out as the best reviewed show, while The Lower Decks appearing so low is equally surprising.

With the jump into the far future in the 3rd season of DISCO, we have the chance to be reintroduced to old friends with new twists. The Vulcans and Romulans are now reunited. Earth has become isolationist and even the federation itself is dramatically altered in size and  in character. 

In this far future, we may wonder about the other races we knew so well. Where are the Klingons and Cardassians? What will the Borg look like in this future?

But we need not wonder about the Ferengi. They will never be seen in this future. 

How can I be sure of this?

It’s because the Ferengi have already been reintroduced.  They are hiding in plain sight and are now called the Orions. In this future, the Orions have become all of the things that the Ferengi were. Or more accurately, they have become all of the things that the Ferengi should have been before they were turned into a joke. 

Let’s think back to the start of TNG. The Ferengi were supposed to be the main villains of TNG. It was an interesting choice. In TOS, the main villains were the Klingons and the main philosophical debate was between cooperation (the Federation) and conquest (the Klingons). This conflict mirrored the Cold War reality at that time between the USA and Russia. In TNG the main philosophical debate was going to be cooperation (the Federation) vs Capitalism (the Ferengi). But sadly this was not the case. The Ferengi bombed and the Romulans took their place. 

But now in DISCO, it seems like we have come back to the start of TNG at least philosophically (cooperation vs capitalism). The only difference is that the Ferengi have been replaced by Orions. 

But have the Ferengi really been replaced? Perhaps the Ferengi have just been reskinned?

Let’s look at the main villain of the 3rd season of DISCO, Osyraa. She looks like an Orion but she sure does act like a Ferengi. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if she had a copy of the Rules of Acquisition in her back pocket. She certainly follows the Rules of Acquisition quite closely. 

Here are some examples of Osyraa following the Rules of Acquisition. 


“ The riskier the road, the greater the profit.” 62nd rule. 
She is a risk-taker. Osyraa takes big risks looking for big payoffs. Stealing Discovery and taking it to the Federation was a big gamble. 


“Know your enemies... but do business with them always” 177th rule. 
She is a businessperson who makes deals to get what she wants. After she got Discovery past the Federation’s shields, what did she do? Attack like a Klingon? No she tried to make a deal. How Ferengi can you get!


“Never ask when you can take”  52nd rule. 
Of course, Osyraa is not always so polite. When she has the upper hand she does as she pleases. 


“There is no honor in poverty” 106th rule. 
“My ancestors knew that power is virtue, and there is no nobility in suffering. “ Osyraa. Nuff said. 


“Never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity” 6th rule. 
Osyraa killed her nephew. As she said herself  “You do what it takes to get what you need, or you don’t.”.  

“Beware the man who doesn't take time for Oo-mox” 223rd rule. Ferengi believe that people should enjoy the sensual pleasures of life. Osyraa is very sensual.  Look at the way she sat on the captains chair after she took Discovery from Tilly. She took time to enjoy her victory. 

“Learn the customer's weaknesses, so that you can better take advantage of him” 87th rule. Osyraa is very manipulative. She has her chief scientist, Aurelio, thinking that she will save the universe as she saved him. 

“Hear all, trust nothing” 190th rule. Ferengi see nothing wrong with telling lies. Lies are a natural part of communication among Ferengi. Trying to figure out what someone is lying about is part of the fun of social interaction as far as Ferengi are concerned. Thus when Osyraa is talking about the lie detector holo, she says “Where’s the fun in that?”. 

Every time I look at Osyraa, I see a Ferengi. 

But wait!

You might say that she is a woman! Ferengi women are not allowed to engage in business!

In this case we can assume that Rom’s reforms of Ferengi society have taken hold and women are now equal to men in Ferengi society.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272476,public,spoiler,There will never be Ferengi in DISCO (spoilers!),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kowahp/there_will_never_be_ferengi_in_disco_spoilers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today I was thinking about how underutilized B'Elanna was.

Just for comparison, Spock had his quarrels with McCoy, the friendship with Kirk. Data explored many aspects of ""humanity"". We could even compare B'Elanna with Ezri, the latter had just one season, but her development was decent. For six seasons B'Elanna was the ""competent engineer &amp; tough half-Klingon"". That's it. Eventually, the writers remembered ""Ohh! we can explore her background!"" - Her mother was introduced in the 6th season (Barge of the Dead - very good episode) and her father in the 7th season (Lineage). Her Maquis background is just a footnote - my goodness, these episodes could have been fantastic.

On first thought it seems handled very well. They managed to effectively remove his disablility and he can function as if he were not blind.

But the more I think about it, is this the right way to treat disability?

There are two ways to do it: modify the environment for the person or modify the person for the environment. What happened to Geordie was the latter but what we seem to do in our society is the former. We try to make accomodations for people whereas they didn't even need to make changes to the environment to accomodate Geordies disability.

When I think of another example of blindness - Tukov in Year of Hell - this was done differently. Tuvok had a tactile interface in order to use the console. This was an example of modifying the environment to accomodate an individual which I think is a better way of dealing with disability rather than just writing it out with a visor. So I end up thinking that they actually handled Geordie's blindness poorly.

Another example of disability is in DS9 melora, which I watched recently. It's about a person who is incredibly weak in normal gravity. Their solution is a radical medical procedure and at no point was it considered to modify the environment to suit her disability. It was such an obvious solution to have her work in a low g environment but they made no accomodation for her disability.

This leaves me to conclude that star trek handles disability very poorly.

Here's the more specific version: power in this context is rated in three categories (with some subcategories) : 1v1 (fist fight and ranged), race vs race (space and ground), and starship competence (crew member and captain). All races have access to the exact same resources (with technology coming from Starfleet) for equal measurments. Superiority in the categories can be achieved through extreme excellence in one aspect or a more general competence. This rule is restricted to races of a sizable population (so no one man races), stability (no races that are going extinct), organic nature (no artificially created races), and single dimensional status (no Q or others like them). The idea behind this question is to determine which race could beat the most others in the three listed categories.

Here's what I want from Discovery (that I'm obviously not getting now):

1. **I want a show that focuses on the** ***crew*** **of Discovery, not on one individual character.** If they are paying these actors to be on the bridge through three seasons, why do I know only half of their names?
2. **I want a show that, at least occasionally, has individual episodes that have nothing to do with a wider universe, a huge story arc, or anything outside the episode.** Just a good self-contained 3-act episode about a crazy planet they find or a mysterious ship adrift in space, etc. With the current formula, you can't have genius stories like ""The Inner Light."" I swear *Breaking Bad* ruined TV on this front; every show has to be written like a damn soap opera nowadays. And yes, get off my damn lawn, you kids.
3. **I want a show that takes a breath every once in awhile.** Slow down the pace, dammit. Show these people *living their lives*. You know, like the poker games on the Enterprise-D, or the crew hanging out in ten forward. Note that there doesn't always have to be a dramatic argument (whisper or loud) or physical fight going on, as is apparently mandatory on the USS Discovery.
4. **I want a show that, at least occasionally, has a clear message based on the actual plot of the episode(s).** Sure, there are plenty of speeches but they rarely have anything to do with the episode and usually they're just talking about how great the Federation is. That's not actually an ethical message, it's just politics and/or propaganda.
5. **Similarly, I want a show that follows consistent ethical standards.** Discovery presents us with the most morally ambiguous Trek series and depiction of Starfleet (until they get to the future where the one and only Admiral is super wise), but I don't know if this is actually a good thing. Especially since it takes place in the prime universe where we have been conditioned to believe that Starfleet and the Federation are almost always attempting to do what is right. How do we go from Discovery with its lying, scheming and machinations to the super-enlightened USS Enterprise only a few years later? If Kirk, Picard, Sisko or Janeway were captain, Burnham would be in the brig and Georgiou would have been tried for war crimes/genocide/whatever other heinous crimes she's clearly perpetrated.
6. **I would like a show that will present an enlightened perspective on social issues, beyond simply having a diverse crew.** This show has way too many characters thrown in simply to represent some demographic and they don't even have enough time to do the characters justice. I'm not gonna name names, but there are some characters on this show that barely have a name or are simply one-dimensional but are clearly included so we can have ""one of them"" in the show. That's actually the opposite of progressive; it's called tokenism. There is a fine line here. If you have a complex character and you decide to cast a minority, that is progressive. If you hastily throw in a minority at the last minute so they can stand in the background, that is. . . sigh, an all-too-common practice in TV and movies. Probably asking too much here.
7. **I want a show that isn't afraid to tackle tough philosophical and/or contemporary issues.** You know, like Star Trek used to do? Even if the message seems dated to us now, the episode ""Let the Be Your Last Battlefield"" from TOS was very relevant and made a powerful statement when it aired. Likewise, ""The Outcast"" from TNG, though dated to our eyes, took an honest stab at dealing with many aspects of sexuality and gender politics. (It would be less dated if they hadn't toned it down from the original conception, and Jonathan Frakes was totally down with it too, according to interviews. . . but we're stuck with what they made. )
8. **I want a show that stays in one ""universe"" for the most part.** Jumping timelines/universes is the scifi screenwriting equivalent of ""and then he woke up."" Just plain lazy. It can be interesting in small doses but not if you turn half the show into that. It give writers an easy way out if they get backed into a corner by a story.
9. **I want** ***fun*** **episodes.** Anyone remember ""The Trouble With Tribbles?"" It may not be an absolute laugh riot but it's cute and makes you chuckle, which is really all that needs to happen. I couldn't imagine an episode like that taking place in the current Discoveryverse.
10. **I want a show that sets limits on itself.** You know, like the fact that the ship can only go so fast, or transporters have a limited range, or people can't *just go anywhere instantly.* When the Enterprise D is being chased by a Borg cube and they can't outrun it, that's genuinely frightening. Discovery is at serious risk of giving itself the Superman problem, wherein there are no real stakes because they have too many incredible powers.

I totally get that my opinions are weird and not universal. I just want to try and explain why I am so frustrated with this particular aspect of Discovery, among others. 

I watch Discovery every week. I enjoy it! The good parts keep me slogging through the bad parts, and there are way more good parts. (Goddamn, did I love seeing human Saru!) 

Now, with that said... 

Things I hate about Burnham as a character: 

- Her emotional reactions are tiring;
- Her dialog is quite often badly written melodrama. 
- She cries too much. 
- The show focuses on her instead of more interesting characters. 
- The other characters worship her for no good reason. 
- She wins by being right when she didn't have enough data to know it. 
- She seems to be specifically designed as the most extreme version of a Mary Sue it is possible to have. Remember that episode of Futurama with Welshy, and the Trekkie fanboy energy being who forced the TOS crew to play out his bad fanfiction? 

Now that you hate me, let me try to win you back. 

Things I love about Burnham as a character:
- Her relationship with Book. I love it when those two are together, they have brilliant chemistry! Especially when the cat is involved. All Hail Queen Grudge! 
- When her and Book were off the ship and having adventures together, I enjoyed the show so much more! I hoped like mad that the season would be half ""Michael and Book wander the galaxy saving endangered species"" and half ""The Discovery crew get to shine without Burnham getting in their damn way"" episodes.
- Her getting high on drugs and ""infiltrating "" a market was fantastic.
- Her and Spock bounced off each other really well. I really got the brother-sister vibe. 
- She's great in action scenes! I love seeing her fight Klingons, or indeed anyone. 

See, all those points, and more, are how I know it's not Sonequa Martin-Green's fault at all. I am outraged at the writers/showrunners for doing this to a perfectly good actor. It's like Robert Pattinson in Twilight, or Deniro in a Sandler movie. 

Discovery is so frustrating! There's so many good people working on it, it has such great ideas, but too often executed so badly, with lazy writing and idiot plots. 

Anyway, hope that helped you understand why people go on and on about Burnham, while still really loving this mycelial-network, mirror-universe, lgbt as fuck, diverse, forward-thinking, defiantly itself, genuine Star Trek show. :)

P. S. The characters I love unreservedly, some of who are part of why I keep watching, who I always want more of: Saru, Stamets, Culver, Adira, Admiral Vance, Tilly (although making her first officer was dumb af), Jett Reno, Lorca, Pike, and Emperor Georgiou (although the crew should have kept hating her as hard as the DS9 crew hated Dukat. Another incomprehensible writing decision!).

In my humble opinion, I think that 13 episode seasons is partially what's killing Discovery this season, and has held it back in the previous two. Without the 10-15 bottle episodes we got with TNG/DS9/VOY, we don't get to see the character growth we're being told is happening off screen. 

If we had episodes driven by and focused on other characters, the focus on Burnham as the central character wouldn't seem so stark and overbearing - it would be more like your Sisko-focussed episodes during the last couple of seasons of DS9. 

Also, it would let Discovery breathe a bit. We're in the 32nd Century, they have the Spore Drive, let's do some discovering!! Revisit more old Trek species. Visit a planet still in the Federation - we haven't seen any yet. Interact with other Starfleet ships and crews - I'm dying to see what the Voyager-J bridge is like, or who her captain is. Show us how other crews react to a 900-year old museum ship appearing and expecting to join the fleet. Explore the new technologies that are suddenly available to a crew 900 years out of place - give me some goddamn technobabble!! 

Discovery likes to tell us what Starfleet and the Federation is all about, but the writers and producers of the show don't seem to realise that Star Trek isn't all about the plot arc, getting from A to B to C and wrapping things up with a tidy little bow. It's the human stories that go alongside it that shows us things like La Forge and Data's friendship, Seven of Nine becoming more human. In Discovery it could easily show why the bridge crew got to like/respect Georgiou, or how the crew got to grips with their new normal in a much reduced Federation.

There are so many stories crying out to be told in this new universe, but 13 episodes ain't enough.

So when it's discovered that they are wanted by the Klingons, Picard sends a fucking security team to arrest them and take them to ~~the brig~~ security. Why doesn't he use site to site transportation?? 

A fight doesn't break out yet, but when they're ready to transport the prisoners to the Klingon battle cruiser, Picard **again** sends a security team to escort them to the transporter room. Not to mention they don't notice the two Klingons openly assembling a disruptor in the cell... So ofc the Klingons kill at least two Starfleet officers.

I understand maybe in the interest of fairness that Picard would want to alert the Klingon fugitives to their situation. But you can do that **and** use site-to-site transport!

Is this a plot hole? Do they address this in the episode and I didn't hear it? Did anyone else notice this? I couldn't find reference to this anywhere online.

**TL;DR**: In this episode, they forgo the use of site-to-site transport when moving Klingon prisoners/fugitives, opting for escort by human security team. This gets two officers killed. Why don't they use the tech? Why can't I find anything about this online?

Honestly I'm kind of ""meh"" on her myself. 

But I think the hatred for her is a bit over-the-top.

You can't win if you're Burnham. If the show portrays you as a capable hero who gets kicks ass and gets shit done, the fandom cries: ""She's a Mary Sue! She's too perfect! It's not Star Trek and it's lazy writing!"" If the show portrays you as being a good-hearted but kinda screwed-up person who grows and changes, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, the fandom cries: ""She's not Starfleet material! This isn't Roddenberry's vision for humanity! It's not Star Trek and it's lazy writing!""

Basically what I'm learning here is that that a huge chunk of the fandom has started from the premise that Michael Burnham doesn't belong on Star Trek and then proceeded to look for reasons why.

And if her mistakes and flaws and bad decisions *do* turn out to have consequences, they're never *enough.* She needs to be punished *more,* for the heinous crime of being Michael Burnham.

Like I said: I'm not the biggest Burnham fan. She's...fine. Like Luke Skywalker is fine, or Harry Potter is fine, or Neo is fine. Or James T. Kirk is fine. A lot of protagonists for action-adventure stories are often just solid viewpoint characters surrounded by a much more interesting supporting cast. Personally I tend to  find the secondary characters more fun and compelling.

But that doesn't make me hate the protagonists for having the job of being protagonists.

Again. If you don't like Burnham, I can't tell you you're wrong for having that opinion (unless it's because of her race or gender, I guess. But other than that). I just don't see why this much of the fandom's emotional energy needs to be expended on hating a character who, in a lot of episodes, is...just kind of *there.*",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272377,public,self,The extreme hatred for Burnham is a little weird.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kodi1o/the_extreme_hatred_for_burnham_is_a_little_weird/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've probably spent more time watching this franchise than any other. And up until a few weeks ago I was a staunch defender of Discovery, despite its lack of continuity. Like many series before it I thought it would figure things out and hit its stride somewhere around season 3. I was wrong.

Past shows got better by eliminating their weaknesses and focusing on their strengths. Unnecessary, or weak plots and characters are jettisoned, and better plots and characters are brought in. Everything gets tweaked until they land on something that feels right. 

We go from this:  [WAREHOUSE FIND: Image (wordpress.com)](https://nostalgiazone.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/star-trek-next-generation.jpeg?w=656) 

To this:  [star\_trek\_next\_generation.jpg (1920×1080) (cbsstatic.com)](https://wwwimage-secure.cbsstatic.com/base/files/star_trek_next_generation.jpg) 

And then they settle on it, and do deep dives into character development. Entire episodes are dedicated to learning about various crew members, and how they are a special and integral part of the team. Over time you find yourself caring about the entire crew and their relationships more. This is done organically through good writing. The way Riker handles being abducted. The way Picard handles living another life in the matter of a few minutes. How Geordi handles being turned into an alien. How the rest of the crew handles those situations together.

\---

When they settled on Saru being Captain of Discovery I sighed in relief. I was getting tired of them flipping through Captains. Saru is my favorite character, too. That episode about his past, and his home planet was really enlightening and made me connect with him. I love stories about characters who grow and become bigger and stronger than they thought they could. 

Finally, I thought, the show can find an identity, anchored by a really great character.

But all through season 3 the plot kept getting FORCED toward Michael in ways that make no sense. I'll just focus on one right now.

Why is Michael at the center of solving The Burn? And why was her strategy for finding it not already explored before she arrived? The technique she used to pin-point the source of The Burn is probably the only option they had, yet she was the only one to think of it? 

For some perspective: As far back as 132 AD ancient China had developed a seismometer to pin point the location of earthquakes. 

Yet, this super advanced society, thousands of years more advanced, can't even *imagine* looking for discrepancies that might help it find a source of The Burn ----- until Michael Burnham arrives? 

Want to know why the show 24 fizzled out? It's because the writers couldn't continually write Jack Bauer into the center of everything going on in the United States without it becoming ridiculous. And that was a show unapologetically about *one man deliberately disregarding orders for the greater good*. 

With Discovery, they're trying to make Michael Burnham the center of everything in the *universe*. It was already ridiculous before the season began, but this year they've tossed any and all common sense out the window and doubled down on their choice to make the show all about her. 

Which would be fine if the writing could make that happen organically. Which would be fine if she was a character worthy of that kind of gravitas. But it's not. And she's not. She's the weakest character on the show. But then we get that line about her being ""Cut out for the captains chair."" Saru, the most professional character with the most intriguing story -- he's not? He's inevitably going to be forced out so that Michael Burnham, the least professional and least interesting character on the show can replace him? 

For the record: I don't hate Burnham's character. I just hate that the show is centered around her and that the plot is written around that. It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense. It's not interesting. It's not fun.

Yes, patterns degrade while in the pattern buffer. But how quickly? I could bring up the episode when Scotty used a transporter for stasis purposes but that is held to have been a special circumstance, the other guy he tried to save didn't make it. This one time, his pattern remained stable for multiple decades. But because it was a fluke, we can't consider it representative.  


There is however a DS9 episode wherein the crew of an exploding spacecraft are rescued via transporter at the last possible moment, but cannot be rematerialized right away. The entire station's memory is cleared so their patterns can be stored (nine people if I recall correctly). Their patterns remained in storage for...A few days? I think?   


This furnishes a more representative example because it wasn't a specially rigged setup by miracle worker Scotty, but a quickly improvised solution using standard transporter tech available on the station. We have no reason to believe O'Brien did anything special with the DS9 transporters in this situation which couldn't be replicated, unlike Scotty's stasis feat.   


That establishes that patterns can be kept in the buffer long enough for the typical away mission and then some without fatal degradation occurring. We know there exists sufficient memory onboard starships for as many patterns as they have transporter pads, as in order to transport that many people simultaneously, they need sufficient memory to keep that many patterns in the buffer during transport.

Lifelong Trekkie, it’s my go-to show when stressed or anxious at night, etc. Have gone to the convention here in Vegas multiple times. Love it all. I just resisted Discovery because of the while All Access thing and some of the spoilers I’ve heard over the years didn’t really interest me.

That said, here’s my unoriginal take: Michael Burnham has turned in to a terrible main character and Discovery is suffering as a result. Mid-Season 3, it got so bad, I almost quit the show (still might). Am I alone in this thought?

Season 1: Klingons aside, I dug first season Michael. I dig everything from lighting to the ‘twist’, all that. I even pressed the ‘I believe’ button on Spock’s secret sister storyline. In hindsight it wasn’t necessary but it made for compelling episodes, so it works.

Season 2: Klingons Corrected. Complete tone shift. Michael means more to Spock, Spock is insane but also saves time and space, show runners boot Discovery to the future with an excellent tie in with a Michael’s mom and her upbringing... solid stuff. Georgiou is loved but not exactly believable for me in most of the situations she’s in.  They finally started building the other characters a la every other Trek show.  I’m excited for Season 3! Michael hangs with her mom, maybe?! We’ll see!

Season 3: The future! ‘Fresh Trek!’ Saru is a boss. He should have his own show. But ... Why is Michael always breaking rules but allowed to continue serving Starfleet in any commanding rank? Her reckoning is to be removed from XO but still finds herself at most of the important decision making meetings? Why is every other line whispered? Why does she come and go as she pleases and why is it always her to fix the issue? She is never wrong and when she is, somehow gets validated anyway. Don’t get me started on somehow whisper-debating her way through several hundred years of Romulan-Vulcan politics in an afternoon and somehow being the only person who thought about checking the black boxes (doesn’t the Chain have some pretty clever folk?). Don’t get me started on Plot-Device-Monk Mom. The Sisterhood of Traveling Candor felt THAT comfortable with such a new acolyte that they’d send her own mother to be Micheal’s second? That whole episode wreaked of hamfisting a narrative just to keep Michael as the plot engine.

Season 3 seems to be Star Trek: Micheal Burnham. Episode 3 is where I started to notice. Season 1 and 2 were always Michael focused bit their plots kinda dictated it. Season 3 has a more ‘global’ plot and for some reason the writers of Discovery are doing everything they can to make Michael an episode-to-episode lynchpin with far too much melodrama.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272350,public,spoiler,Discovery: My Michael Burnham Take [Spoilers],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ko7hqx/discovery_my_michael_burnham_take_spoilers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example in the episode “The Balance of Terror” Kirk quickly picks up that the Romulan Bird of Prey decloaks before it fires because it has to.  According to the Romulan Commander it was like Kirk was a sorcerer who lived in his mind. 

Another great examples is “Charlie X.” In that episode Kirk realizes the powerful Charlie Evans often makes people disappear when he’s angry with them, however he also notices that Charlie stops doing this when he takes over the ship.  Kirk concludes, correctly as it turns out, that Charlie’s power is limited in that if he activates all his ship’s systems he may be able to overload him.  Kirk defeats Charlie just in time for the Thasians to pick him up. 

Even when he was over-powered in The Corbomite Maneuver  he was able to outsmart his opponent by bluffing and does it again in his next encounter with the Romulans.   

Kirk also shows of his skill taking the most sophisticated AIs into killing themselves. And despite his intelligence, Mr. Spock often loses at chess to Captain Kirk.    

However with Trelane all his skills seem to mislead him.  Kirk notices that Trelane likes the mirror and he concludes reasonably that the mirror is the source of his power.  When he destroys it Kirk thinks he has won but doesn't realize that he has miscalculated until he tires to turn his ship around and sees Gothos facing him again.    

As Picard says in the next century "" It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.""

It is worth noting that every time Trelane meets Kirk on even grounds Kirk knocks him on his butt. However the boy god just falls back each time on his power.  Finally he grows board and corners Kirk and the only thing that saves our dear Captain is the arrival of Trelane's parents.

I write Star Trek TOS fanfics on a regular basis, but recently started a crossover fic with Kirk, Picard, Janeway, Sisko, Archer and their crews all teaming up. 

Unfortunately, some steps in, I realized that I’m giving too many awesome moments to the captains I like the best – Kirk and Sisko – and nowhere near enough to the others. So, in the interests of doing justice to the characters, I’m gonna try a sort of referendum. Please cooperate, fellow Trekkies. 

The situation is, there is a Thanos type threat which can wipe out not only the Federation, but the entire Multiverse. Q freaks out, and not being willing/able to risk his own skin, responds by pulling in all the five legendary captains and their crews to handle this.

1. Which captain/crew would be the best to handle a direct battle with the threat

2. Which captain/crew  would be the best to handle the diplomatic part of the mess – try and talk down the threat

3. Which Captain/crew would be the best at distracting said threat by focusing all its attention on them, allowing the other ships to get past and take care of certain business

4. Which captain/crew would be the greatest liability – the most likely to need rescue

5. Which Captains/crews would be most likely to clash with each other

6. Which captain/crew would be the best at a stealth mission

7. There is one captain whom all the other four are united in their desire to throw out of the airlock. Which one should it be

8. Which captain/crew would be the most likely to mess up their part of the plan

9. Which captain/crew would be the likeliest to discover key  information about the threat

I  didn't like DISCO at first. Especially some bad reviews of  Season 1 and 2 really made me think they just went full Star Wars.

Then  came Season 3. I still don't like Burnahm much as a Character but everyone else is just great.

And I am so glad I did. The pilot episode already showed me that there was good enough stuff to go on and that Janeway actually is a fantastic captain (too early to say for sure, but possibly the best captain so far). The second episode with the whole Janeway and B'Elanna dynamic was incredible and I thought it was a fantastic episode.

And I'm not at all convinced the Admiral made the correct decision.

By the Admiral's own admission the ceasefire is an amazing treaty (short of his one request, we'll get to that). We know it ends slavery on countless worlds, and starts a 15 year plan to abandon 50 exploited pre-warp civilizations (a plan likely covered in that treaty he read). As Osyraa rightly pointed out, anything faster would be chaos. You can't just create a power vacuum overnight like that.

We also learned that Osyraa isn't the dictator of The Emerald Chain. She made reference to a parliament/congress (can't remember the word she used) which actually passed laws and needed ""enough support"" to do so. Suggesting a semi-large and diverse legal body. Yes Osyraa has done horrible things, but she is not her government. (I would lake to take a moment now to point out the democracies of the world, mine included, which have spent the past few years enjoying a less-then-idyllic leaders. Now tell me this makes the entire Emerald Chain, that just voted out slavery, evil.)

The ""Episode Discussion"" thread is understandably spare right now at 12:30pm PST, but I am amazed at the number of ""well obviously Osyraa was fooling the lye-detector somehow"" comments. Even without the above legal stuff, can we as a fandom really praise the ideals of the Federation so highly yet not even entertain the idea that Osyraa wants this to work? She may be machiavellian in her methods but she is still a leader. So I am going to accept the fact that the lie detector wasn't faulty and everything Osyraa said was true. Admiral Vance believed it and he knows a lot more about The Chain then we do.

So taking all that into account, I don't think insisting on persecuting Osyraa at the cost of the entire treaty is the right decision. Especcially not when made unilaterally by the Admiral rather then the Federation Civilian Government (which, may I remind you, is located in the same station as Starfleet). In fact I think Osyraa may have even been persecuted anyways in time as The Chain slowly liberalized.

The Galaxy is incredibly destabilized at the moment. The Federation has the dylithium supply and a Spore drive, and dozens of planets and outposts with zero infrastructure. Meanwhile The Chain has is primarily a currier service with the scientific ability to turn that spore drive into a blueprint, but no dylithium. Both sides have what the other needs. Yes The Chain has slavery and oppresses 50 primitive worlds. But it is one Federation signature from ending slavery for thousands if not millions and freeing those worlds. That alone is a stabilizing force but the end of hostilities between the two major powers is even bigger. The distribution of dylithium and eventual spore drive technology is enough to get the galaxy back on track.

So Admiral Vance, if allowing one villan who is now extending the hand of peace to go free goes against Federation principles widespread slavery, the oppression of 50 worlds, and an open state of conflict then I'm sorry. The neighboring nation has a bad egg. Now tell me the Klingons never did in TNG. Or the Romulans during the Dominion War. Heck show me one decade, just one, where a high ranking Starfleet officer didn't go against Federation ideals.

6. Q would interact with the crew of voyager and realize they have become a group of barbarians.  And put them on trial.

The problem is I'm just too lazy to do it lol. And to be fair, I watch tons of Trek all year as it is and the last two years has been tons of it since they announced the Picard show watching tons of TNG and the other shows; including a complete rewatch of DS9 last year when the documentary was coming out. I probably seen at least 200 hours of classic Star Trek in the last two years alone. None of that counts all the new shows like DIS, PIC and LDS. So I'll be rewatching everything I seen!

I decided to do it in chronological order because it's just more fun that way! So I will be going from the 22nd to the 32nd century! Woo-hoo! And this is the order I will mostly watch it in:

1. Enterprise
2. Discovery seasons 1-2
3. The Original Series
4. The Animated Series (Will be my first time EVER watching this BTW)
5. The Original Series movies (TMO-TUC)
6. The Next Generation 
7. Deep Space Nine (seasons 1-3)
8. Generations
9. Voyager(season 1-2)
10. Deep Space Nine (season 4)
11. First Contact
12. Voyager (season 3-4)
13. Deep Space Nine (season 5)
14. Insurrection
15. Deep Space Nine (season 6-7)
16. Voyager (season 5-7)
17. Nemesis
18. Lower Decks
19. The Kelvin movies
20. Picard
21. Discovery (season 3...and maybe 4?)

Damn that's a lot of Star Trek lol. Now, I've given myself until September 8th to finish, but it's not some hard and fast rule. I'm just going to watch as much as I can whenever I can or have the urge to. But hopefully I'll finish it all in the year the latest. The only real rule is to watch every show and movie in order and not skip anything. Yes, even Spock's Brain and Threshold. ;)

And let's be honest, once Discovery is done next week, there probably won't be any new Trek on until late summer/early fall at best. So perfect time for it!

Maybe not one as large as the Enterprise, but definitely a smaller ship with perhaps 75 crew members. 

The world should be EXTREMELY detailed. Think Skyrim level of detail, but scaled down to a ship. Every crew member should have his or her own quarters with his or her own background and personal decorations with a story in their quarters. 

Every crew member has their own schedule and jobs (like in Oblivion but...better).

Every crew member should have their own side mission and you should be able to keep track of crew members like you could keep track of character schedules in Zelda Majora's Mask.

Everyone has interactions with everyone, and they especially have interations with you, like Mass Effect or Tell Tale games.

Can be either 3rd person or 1st person, but im thinking first person would be better.

You play as first officer. You make sure everything on the ship is running accordingly. Engineering, security, science, medical bay, etc all answer to you, but it's your job to make sure they have everything they need to function properly. This is the sim portion of the game.

How well everyone functions will dictate how well your battles go. You will have ship to ship battles, although political and diplomatic methods are preferred. Imagine wanting to have a peaceful resolution with the klingons or romulans, and a peaceful resolution is possible; however, a choice you made earlier in the game makes it impossible, and as such, you get into a battle. If you have done your job properly and engineering/security/medical etc all function properly, you do well in the fight. If you sucked and as such your crew sucks, well, you take heavy damage. 

and in Fire Emblem like fashion, characters actually die. So you may have spent 10 whole hours trying to romance Ensign Lira Lwaxanton and BOOM, she was lost in a hull breach, her body lost to the vacuum of space.

You can have away missions, and they can be small load outs, like planet missions in mass effect 1 only....better.

You can choose your away mission crew. You think it's a good chance for Ensign Timmy Pascal to earn his promotion. The mission is going well, and you can tell Ensign Pascal is trying his earnest not to let you down. You cant help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for your crewman, youre definitely going to put in for his promotion.

THEN BOOM! He gets Tasha Yar'd bc you didnt choose your away team appropriately (like the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2).

Away mission combat would be ripped directly from XCOM. 
Ship to ship battle would be essentially the game ""Star Trek Bridge Crew""

Everything else would be Tell Tale/Mass Effect/Quantum Dream/Majora's Mask/Fire Emblem choice making.

And last but not least: Holodeck. In addition to side missions specifically designed to be trippy (like most holodeck episodes), you can also just straight-up use the holodeck to grind individual crew members for away missions (think Mememtos from Persona 5)",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272257,public,self,Star Trek game developed by Quantum Dream (dream game),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kniulj/star_trek_game_developed_by_quantum_dream_dream/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One consequence was that humanity decided to embark upon a future that was anti-transhumanist. Humans would explore space for enlightenment, rather than becoming post-humans. I almost suspect the Federation itself would have some anti-eugenics feature in its constitution.

That said, the rejection of genetic engineering and transhumanism was in a context in which eugenics was embraced broadly beforehand. Hints from Trek and my sense of Roddenberry's attitudes makes me think that there was eugenics in Trek.

That is, Trek features ""liberal eugenics"". This is where all eugenics is done individually and not institutionally, and it is done in the context of a human relationship producing a child out of love.

You would have a fence of law built around eugenics, but within that fence technology would be applied to the absolute limit. 

First of all ""picking the best fruit"" - where a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are harvested and surveyed and the man and woman can choose which combination of their own genes is preferred.

Second, mate selection based on genetic profiles.

Third, epigenetic management (engineering everything except for the genes).

Fourth, things like best practices for nutrition and child development to unlock the full potential of a person's genetic baseline.

When people date, they'd check genetic profiles as casually as people today talk about whether they want to raise kids in the city or the country. A person who loves music might want to find a gifted musician to have kids with.

But this is all liberalized, so nothing is force, there are no rules to it and you can do ultimately what you want. However, there is effectively a eugenic program in the society.

My evidence for this - and it's more of a Roddenberry conceit - is that Season 1 episode with the child who has calculus homework.

Clearly Roddenberry is implying a few things by this. Educational methods will be ""that good"" in the future, half of why mankind is more mature. Maybe Starfleet are the best of the best, so smart even their kids are natural geniuses.

However, I think - given Roddenberry's very casual and open attitudes about sexual liberalization and how we should shed certain inhibitions and the idea of techno-progressivism - that Roddenberry is implying that people themselves are smarter and better in the future. That this isn't transhumanist (which they back then called ""eugenics""), but rather natural. Which is implicitly eugenecist.

Anyway, I like to sometimes think about the elements of the future in Trek that we take for granted (like no money) and how it might work a lot differently than we think. After all, if we knew how it worked, we'd do it already. The whole point is they've figured some things out that we haven't. That's why it's the future.

Even so, the question of liberal eugenics is interested. Once cultural stigmas wane, there's no reason not to do it. On the other hand, eugenics is a concession that some ""kinds"" of children are more valuable than other ""kinds"". That will play in poorly to social divisions and structural inequities.

We aren't mature enough yet to engage in eugenics with a liberal spirit, we'll use it to embed our imperfections. In this sense, eugenics is paradoxical. It's the quest for a more perfect version of our imperfect selves.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272247,public,self,Eugenics Wars - I Think There Are Still Eugenics In The Future,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/knga5i/eugenics_wars_i_think_there_are_still_eugenics_in/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, one of the things that annoy most fans of a franchise as long running as the Trekverse is the continuity errors. 

And the change in tone of each show – in this same reddit, and almost every place where fans congregate, you can find declarations that DS9/VOY/DIS/ENT/Whatever “just isn’t real Trek.” Me, for instance, loved DS9 for its plot and writing, but don’t want to imagine Federation’s dark sides. (Said dark sides shot upto eleven during Picard, so much that I quit watching that one.) 

One possible explanation – Parallel Universes.

We saw in Parallels that thousands of universes, with much the same individuals, exist at the same time, with their own differences based on individual choices. Each show and each Movie Series  is from a different parallel universe – each universe has/had a Kirk/Picard/Janeway and their teams, but each universe also has subtle differences, different choices.  The TOS universe is not the same as TNG one, the DS9 universe is not the same as the VOY one, the movies are not set in the same universe as the shows, and so on.

So in one universe Federation remained the Knight In Shining Armor, in another it took a level in jerkass, in one universe Data lived long enough to be an admiral, in another he died in Nemesis, in one Universe Picard was disillusioned and broken, in another he is still with the more or less idealist Federation, and so on.

That, at least, is my headcanon. (Mostly fueled by a need to undo the depression from  watching the Kelvinverse films and Picard back to back – Okay, it happened, but it didn’t happen to the Spock and Picard I fell in love with! Sigh… I am taking this a bit too seriously.)",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272199,public,self,"Parallel Universes – Or, How To Explain Continuity Errors",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kn64mb/parallel_universes_or_how_to_explain_continuity/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enter Lower Decks. It takes itself less seriously than other Treks, and can do things other Treks would never attempt. Eugene Cordero and Tawny Newsome are both incredibly talented singers (see their episodes of ""Off Book: The Improvised Musical"" if you have any doubt.) Also one of the hosts of that show, Jess McKenna, plays Ensign Barnes and the Cerritos computer. They could get a big name star with singing chops to play the Q who sets this all in motion.

Try and follow me on this. The concept of the Multiverse is based on the idea that for every choice there is a reality that stems from that choice. Actions and consequences. Other names and/or depictions of this concept include alternate timelines, dimensions, realities, etc. Much like with the plot of “Steins Gate” anime which is based on the “World Line Theory” 

Now, the federation universe is fundamentally different than the mirror universe because essentially the entire universe is different. Almost polar opposites. Following the Worldline theory each universe belongs to a separate “attractor fields” because event took place that was so significant that it changed the entire reality of that universe to diverge from the federation universe. In the mirror universe “Terrans” are violent conquerors whom have spread throughout the alpha quadrant enslaving, destroying and generally conquering every world they came across. The Federation universe works much the same way but only in a peaceful manner where humans venture out in an exploration manner with friendly intent and curiosity which ultimately gives birth to the federation of planets.  

Our only point of reference here where the universes go separate paths is during first contact. However, in the scene where Zefram Cochrane is to meet the Vulcans as you see in Star Trek Enterprise it is almost as if they had been expecting aliens to visit them. Almost as if they knew aliens were out there. Zefram Cochrane believed that the Vulcans were would-be invaders, so he killed them and raided their ship. Why would he think that especially when they were showing peaceful intent? 

Enter Nog. In DS9 the episode “Little Green Men” Nog, Quark, and Rom end up crashing on earth in the far past. It was like the 50’s-60’s era. I suppose the fault wouldn’t solely land on Nog since his uncle Quark was posing attempting to sell future technology to the Americans with a threat to sell to their competitors instead which lead to suspicion of their circumstances. Ultimately it was Nog whom laid the final brick in that when he attempted to bluff by telling them they were an advanced scout for an invasion fleet. Humans, specifically Americans were very suspicious people at the time due to the Russian threat so to plant the seed of doubt in their minds about friendly alien life could have lasted throughout the ages until first contact. 

Considering all that I have said. The Theory stands that Nog is the cause and thus creator of the mirror universe.  Because he created a reality changing event that shaped the future so dramatically that it split the universe into 2 separate universes. One where humans were friendly and curious about the galaxy, and one where humans were xenophobic and mistrustful of all alien life resulting in their conquering nature.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272161,public,self,Mirror Universe theory,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kmwwow/mirror_universe_theory/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here goes, I'll start with the good traits/quirks:


Honesty: I truly believe thatone should always be honest, no matter the consequenses.

Logical: I will openly admit that I am definately a man of logic.

Reasonable: I CAN get hot headed from time to time, but I'm not one for doing domething unreasonable.

Proud: This I can see as both a good thing and a bad thing, but in a good way, I feel a sense of pride more often then not after acomplishing something that I believe to be significant.

Humble: I hate toting myself off like the best thing since sliced cheese, If anything I think people overestimate my abilities.

Loyal: I NEVER turn my back on a friend or family member unless they have done something I cannot forgive them for.

Understanding: I am nothing if not willing to pay attention and understand others problems.

Kind: I do think my kindness might lead to my death eventually, but I can't help it, nothing feels better than showing someone a little kindness.

Caring: This trait reinforces alot of my particular gripes about society and the state our world is in.

Tolerant: It is very hard to get me all rilled up, simple as that.

Univerality/Keeping things the same: I do love to keep things to just one thing, I despise Competition like it's the bubonic plague.

Adaptability: To some degree I am adaptable, but in others, I am not.

Lack of Individuality/Drone/Everyone the same: While I DO agree that if everyone was the same the world would be very boring, but i would rather live in a boring, peaceful world than a diverse, chaotic one.

Anti-Capitalist/Pro-Communist: I despise Capitalism and the people who accept it, and I fully support Communism(and no Russia was never true Communism, I suggest you read the Communist Manifesto by Carl Marxx before you go giving Communism any flac)

Honourable: I am a man with much, much honour.

Go-Getter: When something needs doing that I know needs doing, I will go do it.

Anti-Warring: I truly believe that wars are wasteful, illogical, unreasonable and unwanted.

Misanthropic: Because of the fact that society refuses to change for the better(aka go back to how society was in the 80's and 90's), my hatred of society is quite immense.

Philantropic: I believe that the world CAN change for the better, and it falls onto those with large sums of money to make that change happen, sadly.

Wise: I have those moments where someone asks me for some life advice and I lay on some words of wisdom.

Nostalgic: I love the past, I hate the present, I am hopeful for the future.

Reliable: I can always be counted on to get something done that needs to be done.



Now the bad traits/quirks

Arrogant: I wouldnt say I'm fully arrogant, but there are things I will flat refuse to accept for one reason or another.

Pride: I admit, at times pride does blind me, but without pride, I could never survive.

Anger: I'm not quick to anger, nor easy to anger, but when I do get angry I become very vocal, fortunately I am not owtwardly aggressive.

Regretful/Remorsefull: I hate my past and would desperatly love to change it.

Jealous: Mostly when it comes to women, if I see a beautiful woman attached to another man and not me, I do die inside.

Vengeful: Only towards one guy from my past, but if you push me that far over the edge and yeah, I become quite vengeful.

Lazy: Oh yeah, guilty as charged.

Paranoid: I'm always looking over my shoulder, afraid of getting stabbed in the back for no reason.

Emotional: Emotions are illogical, unreasonable and as human history has shown, it too unpredictable, Emotions should always be suppressed, although sadly for me my attempts to supress my emotions backfire very miserably, anger being the one that is the worst, having supressed my anger for nearly 26 years(I was 27 at time of writing), and now bottling up my anger only causes it to burst out worse, for an example, if say someone is trying to antagonise me on purpose and were pushing me till I snapped, my first instict would be to beat the ever beloved shit out of them till they were on the ground unconsious, but instead I try to bottle up that anger knowing that letting it out won't do any good, and instead I beat the shit out them untill they died, so yeah Anger is one emotion I have sadly learned that bottling up will only lead to something worse, Humans make very illogical decisions all based on their emotions, not by logic.

We know that Bajoran civilization began to flourish “more than five hundred thousand years ago”, which is 100 times longer than Human civilisation has been around, this implies that while the ancient Bajorans were renowned for their accomplishments in science, mathematics, philosophy, and the arts, as a species they developed very slowly compared to other species as they had only just achieved warp the year the Cardassian invasion started (presumably a contributing factor, with the Cardassians potentially being afraid they would lose influence to the Bajorans).

This means that it’s possible that the Bajorans could have been stuck with sunlight technology for hundreds of not thousands of years with the solar sails being a later generation of this, presumably the Bajorans had thousands of years of space exploration if humans have been exploring space of sorts for 500 years.

The Hebitians, the first civilisation on Cardassia only emerged about 10,000 years before 2376, hundreds of thousands of years after the Bajoran civilisation had emerged, so my theory is that about 10,000 prior to DS9, the Bajorans experimented with sunlight generational ships attempting to settle people in nearby worlds, the first attempt at these ships was thought lost when they stumbled upon tachyon eddies, which accelerated their lightships beyond the speed of light and enabled them to reach the neighbouring Cardassian system. Crash landing in the desert world they established a new civilisation, the Hebitian civilisation and somehow, perhaps through genetic engineering, they became cold blooded “reptilians” perfectly adapted to live in a hot desert environment.

There is actually some evidence that could support this, first is the fact that Bajorans and Cardassians are the only two species in the entire franchise that we know can reproduce naturally without any medical intervention, binary cloning or genetic tampering at all, which is shown or implied to be needed for every other hybrid species (this lead to a theory that the two species are somehow the same which forms the basic premise of this theory), it’s never explicitly stated so it might not be, but it is very likely the Bajoran-Cardassian hybrids are fertile. This fits the common definition of being the same species which implies that even after the alterations that lead to the Cardassians different appearance and adaptations, the robust genetics remains the same.

The ancient humanoids are not an explanation for the ability for the two species to naturally reproduce, as I previously stated other specieslile Humans and Vulcans are shown to require a lot of medical intervention to combine the DNA and even then it’s quite rare, the species only have a common ancestor in a single cells amoeba, that’s like expecting a Human and a Banana to naturally reproduce.

There is also the fact that the Hebitians were described as being an agrarian society as well as farmers, scientists and artists, exactly like the Bajorans were before the occupation.

At one point the Hebitians feel and the militaristic Cardassian civilisation replaced it, yet genetically they were still the same species, the Cardassians grew a deep hatred for the Hebitians and tried to eradicate all traces of their culture from Cardassia Prime, perhaps this lead to an unconscious cultural bias against the Bajorans or perhaps the Cardassians had discovered the Hebitians were actually Bajorans and destroyed all traces of them to cover it up as it would have negated the belief they were the “superior species”.

There are a few holes in this theory, being that if Bajorans were capable of building and launching ships 10,000 years ago, how exactly the Bajorans came to look like Cardassians and the exact reason for destroying any traces of the Hebitians, but if we fill in the blanks, the theory would actually make a lot of sense. I have tried to give some examples to fill in the blanks such as the potential genetic engineering to tailor the colonists to a desert environment.

She knew that he and micheal were working together.  Letting him on her ship was really dumb.  If I was the ruler of a corrupt empire (not a job I would want) I wouldn't want anyone near me except for people who's loyalty I was sure of.  And I would have them take lie detectors to confirm their loyalty.  To let the leader of a band of revolutionaries on your ship when you have hundred's of his followers imprisoned there is really stupid.  Especially when you know that the person who brought him onboard is working for him.  So emperor georgiou was a fool or really overconfident.

Star Trek Discovery isn’t bad because of the casting or diversity, it’s bad because of the writing and character decisions. All this “forced diversity” is just “diversity” but with an extra word added. It’s all about the writing imo. They could cast an old black guy and write him so bad and people would dislike it. Writing is important in a show as big as Star Trek. Sexuality and Diversity has always been in the franchise as a whole, you cannot discredit a show for wanting to do it more. 

The effort of writing is where the struggle for the characters come in, your interest in their struggles because that’s what makes a person ‘human’, audiences respond to fear and levels of self doubt and the character development allows all that to flourish when characters grow, if a character (or characters) are already strong then what’s the point there is absolutely no way of riding around the development because they end up as a blank slate (aka BatWoman, example: Kate Kane literally showed up to Gotham with no combat experience and demanded her suit regardless of the fact she never had any fighting or combat experience just like Bruce Wayne did, Bruce always trained yet she didn’t and she’s hardly comparable in size)

Next is the approach to handling diversity is important, you don’t wanna hammer every alphabet in there or race otherwise fans will notice and start to realise it only exists to preach to the audience, there are reasons BatWoman did so horribly no one not even the “sjws” wanted it but it’s quite strange they were all for it until the show began, the ratings dropped and they will continue to so unless they scrap their writers room and get someone who can handle better writing and a less-self indulgent show runner.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,272072,public,self,Star Trek Discovery is ehhh...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kmftpj/star_trek_discovery_is_ehhh/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I remain hopeful that this is a misdirect, and somehow there'll be a more satisfying explanation, but I thought it might be fun to spitball some ideas to see what creative minds we have in the sub, and to see if we could come up with a more satisfying solution than we've seen so far.

I'll start off with a possibility that I've put together. I'm taking it from the beginning of the last episode, and keeping everything pretty much the same up until that point. Personally, I'd have been disappointed if it did end up being a Q or something like that because, again, it would feel to me that Discovery is just leaning on nostalgia and not standing on its own two feet.

So, the way I would have played out events is as follows. Discovery follows the distress signal to the same location, the nebula, and they still find the dilithium nursery planet inside. We know from previous episodes that there were experiments going on to tackle the growing scarcity of dilithium, and we find out that the site where the burn began was due to another experiment - someone (maybe even the Kelpien scientist) had developed a spore drive.

Unfortunately, they ran into similar problems that Discovery and her sister ship did early on - they didn't have a navigator. When they activated, they were pulled into the dilithium nursery, and this triggered a cataclysmic reaction that travelled back along the mycelial network, rendering most other dilithium inert, since it's connected to everything in the galaxy. At this point, you could have Stamets explain that, when he's been navigating the network, he always felt a pull towards certain places, and hadn't considered that they might be places containing massive amounts of dilithium before.

Now, you could still have Osyraa taking over the ship with this plot, but she DOESN'T know that Stamets is the navigator, and so you have the struggle of trying to convince her not to do a jump/outright trying to stop her so that you have the tension going forward. 

This gets resolved through various stuff (haven't figured this bit out), and eventually all is resolved. Stamets mentioned that it's not just those coordinates he's felt drawn to within the network, and therefore it's realised that he's able to seek out these dilithium nurseries, thereby resolving the shortage and helping to start bring the Federation back together again (instead of Burnham saving the day for a change!).

I think the bridge Science officer would be a stand-out among other science personnel aboard the ship and have leadership skills in addition to a well rounded-science background with their own specialty.  

Various science department heads that work in the labs aboard the Enterprise would report daily to the bridge science officer (similar to how Chief O'Brien did his daily maintenance with staff aboard DS9) about findings they want to submit to Starfleet / ship-board resource requests / upcoming studies they would like to conduct with their staff.

It is on TV here in the evenings on a constant loop of repeats but I got  a box set of the whole series and now I've started going through them  from the beginning.

I've seen every Star Trek film and every episode of every Star Trek series ... except *Lower Decks*, which I started this afternoon! I've watched some of the Trek series all the way through multiple times.

A common thing about the Trek films &amp; series is that they all are told from the perspective of Starfleet personnel. *Star Trek: Picard* toys a little with being non-Starfleet ... but, of course, the title character is about as Starfleet as you can get.

However, I have grown a bit tired of the Starfleet perspective, so I'm looking for content in the Trek universe that's different. 

Since I've already seen *all* the films &amp; TV series, can you recommend *other* Star Trek works (i.e., books, comics, games, really good fan fiction or fan series) with the following characteristics: 

* Set in the Trek universe
* *Not* episodes/seasons/installments of any of the existing canon Star Trek series or films (since I've already seen them all)
* Most importantly, tells stories from the perspective of *non-Starfleet* characters

I'm hoping to find stories in the Trek universe that represent something other than the mission and perspective of Starfleet and it's personnel. I want to experience the perspective of the other inhabitants of the Trek universe -- the ones who don't live in a Federation ship/base/academy.

Much better show than anyone gives it credit for. Obviously I was not a fan of the ending for all the reasons I think anyone could imagine. 

But that made me start thinking about how other Trek series have ended. Did a rewatch of the Voyager finale last night - I think i’ve seen it 4 or 5 times now - and it’s the first time i’ve ever wondered “was this a good finale for this show?” I have no problem about them finally getting back to the Alpha Quadrant but I kept thinking 

“Does this ending work for this show?”

I think my big issue is Admiral Janeway explicitly calling her past self out for destroying the caretaker’s array. I’m sure every fan has their own feelings on it, I know I do, but I certainly believe that Janeway’s actions for the rest of the series strengthen the point she was trying to make by rejecting the array: That the values of starfleet are important and worth struggling for. 

And then you’ve got Admiral Janeway sayings “No, I don’t really think they are. Not how me and my crew struggled.” the finale deals with this quickly by having captain janeway pushback and deus ex borging the admiral out of of the story....but I’ve still got wonder.

Captain Kirk was the Captain of the Enterprise in both universes.  Spock was still the first officer, Scotty the chief engineer for both as well.  Uhura, Sulu, Chekov almost everyone down the line was still doing the same thing their counterparts were in prime universe.  Dr. McCoy managed to spill acid in the same place in both realties.    

On Discovery however it is different.   Philippa Georgiou is the Captain of the Shenzhou. Her fate is she is killed and eaten by Klingons.  In the mirror  Philippa Georgiou is Emperor of the Terran Empire, has conquered the Klingons, and eats Kelpiens.

Michael Burnham was at the start of the series first officer of the Shenzhou before her fall.  In the mirror was the Shenzhou's captain and heiress apparent to the Empire.

Sylvia Tilly at the start of the series was a Starfleet cadet while her mirror counterpart was the Captain of the Discovery.

First, I know I won't be covering any new ground, so I apologize.  But I've become frustrated with a thing I love, Star Trek, and think venting might make me feel better. 

Second, I am 40 years old and have been a Star Trek fan all my life. I remember being teased for it in elementary school, hiding it in high school (and beyond), going to conventions in the 90s, and starting for hours at Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise and the Enterpise D Technical manual.  I have watched all of it, and mostly love all of it.  (My opinions on the Kelvin Universe are a separate rambling post).

My rant:  I have enjoyed Discovery for most of its run so far. I have the same criticisms I think most of us have and clearly see the show's flaws. The frantic pace of the first two seasons, the awkward storytelling, making Michael the center of the universe, etc., but the most recent episode is the first time I've felt close to giving up (I obviously won't, but I hate feeling like this). 

-I hate Ensign Tilly being Number One (As much as I hate Pine's Kirk being ""acting captain""), but I understand the showrunners like the actor and character, so I've tried to go with it.  She did a good job in the role, but she was a cadet one season ago, and there are more experienced officers available.  It's beyond absurd watching it in action.    

-Stamets trying to prevent Hugh from going on the mission was strange, awkward to watch, and makes no sense.  They're both professional Star Fleet officers!  It's what they signed up for.  Plus, it's far from the most dangerous mission we've seen a character go on.  I didn't understand it.  We already know they love each other.  

-The Adira and Gray subplot is pointless.  Him going away maybe helped develop Adira's character somewhat, but we find out he went away for...reasons, and now he's back for...other reasons?  His return was out of place in this episode and felt forced.  I like the character Adira, but could have passed on Gray coming back.  

-Also, have we established that people can just beam through shields?  What was the point of upgrading Discovery with 31st-century tech?  

-Finally, and maybe most importantly, making the Burn be an emotional alien we've never heard of feels like a slap in the face.  I know we've seen Gary Mitchell and other hyper-powerful beings in Star Trek before, but this is a season-long arc.  Maybe it'll be better in the final two episodes, but this is rough.  Why do writers of things we love feel the need to ""subvert expectations"" so much?  GoT and Star Wars sequels anybody??  This could have been the omega particle.  And somehow fixed by Discovery's spore drive.  Keep the rest of the season arcs and get rid of the exploding dilithium planet, and come up with some way Discovery has to risk itself to save the future of the Federation.  I don't know.  I'm not a paid writer.

(I know, I know, bear with me: this is a Trek question ultimately.) 

I'm struck by the difference between the ST and SW universes (not a new revelation, of course). Trek is Roddenberry's post-scarcity, shiny, positive outlook for the future. While in George Lucas's world, the good guys also eventually win (sorry if that's a spoiler; get over it), the Star Wars stories don't hesitate to dive into the seedy side of its universe (rogues, smugglers^1 , bounty hunters, junk dealers, slavery, criminals, etc.) in a way that rarely occurs with Star Trek and its focus on the, frankly, goody two-shoes Federation crews.

(Initially I was excited that *Star Trek: Picard* seemed to be going a different way in the first few episodes, but it swung back to typical Star Trek morality play-style by the end of Season 1.) The &gt;!Terran Empire and Section 31!&lt; injected a little welcome intrigue and moral ambiguity into Season 2 of *Discovery*, but not as much as I would have liked. 

So the question. I've seen all the series and films now (except for *Lower Decks*, which is up next in my queue), but I haven't explored much outside the films &amp; TV shows. **Are there *any* Star Trek works (books, comics, games, etc. ... maybe even really good fan fiction?) that (a) are set in the Trek universe, but (b) don't tell stories about a Federation ship and its crew and (c) deal with the grittier side of the Star Trek universe?**

I had heard great things about DS9 for years, and just from the bits I did hear, I knew it was probably going to be my favorite Star Trek series. While I've only finished TOS and TNG, I think it's safe for me to say that I was right, and that DS9 is my absolute favorite. I think the best indicator for how much I enjoyed it is this: It took me around a year, maybe a year and a half to finish TOS. I took me two years to finish TNG. It took me around two months to finish DS9. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love TOS and TNG, and also probably has something to do with the former two's heavier episodic focus, but I just couldn't get enough of DS9.

While I did miss the episodic, exploration focused style of TNG, I think DS9 more than made up for it with how well it handled its characters and story. This was easily my favorite cast of characters in Star Trek, and I don't see them being topped. Each one of them were so interesting and layered, and had excellent development throughout (shout out to Kira for being my favorite character, and my second favorite Star Trek character period). Even the minor characters were amazing, to the point where I'd say I like Damar, Nog, Weyoun, Rom, and Martok just as much, and in some cases more than, some main cast members in previous Star Trek's. And theit relationships were so great, it even gave the best bromance ever! This is seriously one of the greatest casts I've ever had the joy of experiencing in media.

And the stories were excellent. Many of the episodic adventures were amazing, easily just as good, if not better than the best of TNG, and when the sequential episodes were fantastic, and really showed that Star Trek could work in different formats than just the typical episodic structure. 

I also have to applaud it for being the most consistent show. TOS has it's very underwhelming third season, TNG has a rocky start, and while the last two seasons are great, I felt as though the consistency was starting to dip a bit. DS9, however was great from beginning to end, if anything, it only gets bettter. I think I've heard that people aren't too fond of the first season, and while I agree that it was the weakest one and you could tell that they were finding their footing, I honestly thought it was pretty good, probably around the same level of quality as TNG S6 and 7, maybe a bit lower. 

I also want to tackle some more spoiler heavy topics, mainly concerning stuff that I either have issues with or am just a bit mixed on, so I'll go into those now:

&gt;!Might as well start with Dukat. What an amazing villain! At first, I didn't understand why people loved him, and then I watched Neccessary Evil, and it all became clear. However, I know some people do not like the direction his character went after Sacrifice of Angels. Personally, I like it, but I do admit that I liked pre-breakdown Dukat a good bit more than post-breakdown Dukat. Like, I think it makes sense story and character-wise, especially when the Pah Wraiths really come into the mix, and I do think that they needed to either get rid of Dukat or do something new with him after SoA, and he's still an enjoyable character and villain, but I do enjoy him when he's more of a complex character, rather than a raving mad man out for revenge. He's still a good character, just different and simpler.!&lt;

&gt;!Speaking of the Pah Wraiths, I'm not really sure what to make of them. They work as a way to create conflict in order to give the whole Prophets plotline an ending, but they just sort of felt...I guess segmented from everything else, especially near the end. That last showdown with Sisko and Dukat wasn't bad, but rather than an plotline that felt as if it were as equal to the Dominion War in terms of importance, it felt more like the story went ""Oh wait, one more thing!"" and quickly took care of it. I guess I can sum my thoughts up as I think it was a good idea that could have been integrated better. Oh yeah, and Kai Win, almost forgot about her. Again, I think her character arc in s7 made sense, but it was over a bit too quick for me and was too isolated from everything else!&lt;

&gt;!I am definitely not a fan of the Odo and Kira romance, never got why they kept pushing it in that direction. Okay, I kinda get it for Odo, but not Kira, especially after how he acted when the Dominion took over DS9. I loved their friendship, I think they worked great as friends, but as lovers? I'm sorry, I don't buy Kira having romantic feelings for a guy who has done, and believes in, some very sketchy things that go against her beliefs and values.!&lt;

&gt;!Jadzia is the character who grew on me the most, going from a character that I didn't have any strong feelings towards at all, to one I really liked. I knew her death was coming (I don't remember how I got spoiled, I think I looked up the cast or something and got spoiled that way), but it still got to me. Not the biggest fan of how it was handled, and from what I've heard from the BtS stuff, I'm disappointed in why it happened, but I think killing off a main character worked for DS9, and it being the one who could technically come back made for some interesting stories. I like Ezri, and I think they did a good job at integrating her with only one season left, but I admit, throughout s7 I kept thinking ""I miss Jadzia"" and ""I wonder what this scene would be like if it where Jadzia instead"". Again, I like them both though.!&lt;

&gt;!To end the spoiler section on a positive note, I really have to give credit to how the handled Damar, because wow, I am honestly surprised with how well the handled him, and how much I like him as a character. I honestly thought he would just be some minor grunt who I would like, but not think much of, but his development from a grunt, to a miserable, drunk who reluctantly serves the Dominion, to a revolutionary who leads his people to freedom was just perfect. And to have him come to some level of understanding when it comes to how horriblethe Bajoran occupation was through the Dominion occupation of Cardassia was fantastic, and again demonstrates how nuanced Star Trek, and DS9 especially can be when it comes to writing. It doesn't absolve him of all the horrible things he had done, but it does show that even someone like Damar has the capacity to grow, and I truly think that if he had lived, that he would have tried to repent for the Bajoran Occupation in someway. Again, doesn't absolve him, but at least it shows that he had the capacity to be a better man. I seriously just love Damar as a character, he's one of my top favorite Star Trek characters.!&lt;

I feel like I said everything I needed to, and I expect that I haven't said anything that hasn't already been discussed many times, but I hope you've enjoyed my excited rambling. Deep Space Nine was truly something special, and it has become something that I will hold with me forever. Now to watch What We Left Behind, and then onto Voyager! I know that from here on out, things get more contentious, but I'm going to go into Voyager with an open mind and a positive attitude, and hopefully come out the other end satisfied. 

And as one last note to end on, I thought I'd give my (tenative) Top 10 episodes, in no specific order: Neccessary Evil, The Visitor, Far Beyond the Stars, In the Pale Moonlight, Tacking Into the Wind, Rocks and Shoals, The Die is Cast, Civil Defense, It's Only a Paper Moon, and What You Leave Behind.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,271926,public,self,"I just finished watching Deep Space Nine for the first time, and I have to gush!",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kln3k3/i_just_finished_watching_deep_space_nine_for_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are a few ideas for how to have better security and how to repel boarding parties.  

1. Put a self destruct button on the captain's chair.  That can only be activated by the captain.  The computer can confirm it's the captain by dna scan.  Also label it something different so it's not obvious it's a self destruct button.  Have the self destruct button also lockout the computer and command functions.  The boarders can either leave or be vaporized.
2. Have the computer track crew members so it can identify non crew members.  And increase gravity by five or ten times to pin them to the floor.  And or beam them into the brig or the shuttlebay.  
3. Use transporter scrambers to prevent boarding actions in the first place.  No one is going to want to beam aboard your ship if they think they are going to end in trillions of pieces.
4. Holographic soldiers.  Use holographic soldiers to repel boarding parties.  You could make an army of holograms that activate if the ship is boarded.
5. Interior defenses.  Set up turrets and maybe smoke grenades throughout the ship.  If anyone beams onbard without permission the turrets stun them while the smoke grenades create a distraction.  
6. For the 32nd century you could program the programmable matter consoles to strangle anyone who isn't a member of the crew.  Or have them turn into phasers and stun non crew members.
7. Make it so that the self destruct button also activates all of the ships defenses and does all of the above.  You could arm the self destruct and beam the boarding parties into the brig.  And activate holographic soldiers.  And interior defenses.  And have the programmable matter deal with the boarding parties, etc.  Basically activating all of the ships security systems with one button.  

So the federation really needs to have plans to repel boarding parties.  And have better security on their ships.

Diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies.  Or on rare occasions when they just happen to be sane and reasonable.  But how often is that the case.  If the federation was more powerful then the borg then they could negotiate a peace treaty with them.  Because the borg would know that if they didn't sign the treaty they would be wiped out.  Or that a war would cost them too much.  So diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies.  Otherwise diplomacy will fall on deaf ears.  

If the federation really wants peace then they should start arming their ships better and preparing for war.  If their neighbors think that a war will be too e expensive then they will be more inclined to want peace.  This is why the romulans haven't gone to war with the federation in two centuries.  In kirk's era he destroyed a bird of prey that was testing federation defenses.  And in picard's era the alliance between the klingon empire and the federation kept the romulans at bay.  So if the federation really wants peace it should start building more warships.

Maybe in Picard's Spin-off. Hence, the fact that Bashir — the actor, not the character wants in on an episode of Picard or a future Trek Series due to an article. I want to see Genetically Enhanced Humans or G.E.H. within all the Quadrants and maybe a comic between the Q. Sure... it could be a little dull because they would have some sort 100% Success or lower of Probability depending on the scenario — no such thing as no win scenario unless it wasn't realistic. They would also leave no margin for error. If the writers can do the same thing with Data — which was accepting Androids to an extent, I want to see them do the same thing with G.E.H. Cause they did revive that concept in Archer's time which lead to Dr. Soong's Creation, Data and Lore — possibly Khan, but it was never said, or so I think. 

According to [Moore,](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/47284/why-is-genetic-engineering-illegal-in-the-federation), *'""I kept saying 'What's the secret of Bashir's past? What's the thing that this guy Zimmerman is going to find that's so interesting?' I remember that René and I started talking about genetics, and René pointed out that genetic engineering is one of the things that is oddly missing in the Star Trek universe. It's a concept that's very much out there in science fiction, and even in the real world of science, but in Star Trek, it's virtually never discussed, aside from the fact that there was this thing called the Eugenics Wars at some point, and Khan came out of it."" That conversation ultimately led Moore to come up with the idea that Bashir was genetically enhanced.'

TL;DR: I want to see more Genetically Enhanced Humans in Star Trek. I want to see more than just a glimpse of the Eugenics Wars and if the Genetically Enhanced Humans were ever actually accepted into society proving that they could actually function without causing wars like Bashir, then I guess it could be fine.

It has so much to offer and I feel like each time I've watched it I came away with something more. I first watched it as a kid with its original airing. I loved the epic space battles and cool aliens and it really cemented my love of the sci fi genre. TNG always felt like it had the ""alien of the week"" whereas DS9 just had the casualness of the background characters walking on the station and the makeup dept could just do anything they wanted. It felt like better world building. My 2nd watch through was about 10 years ago when netflix first started streaming. I was older and could better appreciate the politics and relationships. I'll never understand why the show got flak for switching to season and series spanning arcs for their stories. It leads to amazing character development with great actors really getting to flesh out their roles. On this third watch I really was able to pay attention to the writing and catch all the fun little things they threw into their scripts over the years. Self-sealing stembolts and 2309 bloodwine being just a couple of the little things that I never would have caught as a kid watching 1 episode a week. But now when we can binge and seeing them get carried through all the seasons as little in-jokes and throwaway lines where you can tell the writers we're just having fun is nice. I feel like DS9 was the total package when it came to episodic science fiction. It gave us space battles, cool aliens, romance, politics, religion, espionage and intrigue, science and engineering with the fun treky twist, and through it all just told a good story.

The Borg have a hive mind just like Bees, Ants and Termites, they are social creatures and they act as one as one living organism.

**Facts we know about how Borg work:**
1. They move as one, because they assimilate other species to be ""perfect"".
2. They can communicate to each other and hear other voices all the time.
3. Its a online connection that isn't broken unless they become a individual.
4. Seven of Nine got separated and was very scared and agitated to be apart from the collective.

**Facts we know about how Bees work:**
1. They work as one single organism within the hive, as workers and drones.
2. They can communicate with each other through nothing more then a few “dancing” movements.
3. The connection between the Bees is unbroken unless one gets separated from the hive and becomes an individual.
4. Bees separated from their hive are known to sting people and animals which is a sign of them being scared or agitated.

Hive minds don’t literally have one single mind, they have individual connected minds that act like a single consciousness, each brain acts like the individual cells of a larger brain.

The Borg Queen literally control every drone as if they were puppets, in reality she is just the mouth piece for diplomatic purposes, she is even created by the drones themselves to function as a “mother” figure, we even see her die at least 3 times only to be replaced by a new Queen. Therefore the collective didn’t “explode” on her death as they continued existing without her.

**Some definitions of hive minds:**
1. A notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another, regarded as producing either uncritical conformity or collective intelligence.
2. (in science fiction) A unified consciousness or intelligence formed by a number of alien individuals, the resulting consciousness typically exerting control over its constituent members.
3. The apparent consciousness of colonies of social insects such as ants, bees, and termites.

Hive minds exist in Earth, there’s no reason to assume the Borg hive mind would work differently.

So stop being a Pakled, crying about the Borg having a Queen and being rude to anyone who likes the idea of a Borg Queen just because you misunderstood basic science when the Borg were first introduced.

Who Watches the Watchers was actually the first TNG episode that was pretty good.  But...I had issues.  

Who Watches the Watchers stirred me up.

&gt;TROI: According to Doctor Barron's preliminary reports, the Mintakans are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful and highly rational.  
PICARD: Which is not surprising, considering how closely their evolution parallels Vulcan.

Picard, you’re an idiot. When the Vulcans were in their bronze age they were skewering each other like crazy. They only got peaceful and rational after inventing space travel and nearly annihilating themselves in their own version of World War III.

&gt;CRUSHER: Before you start quoting me the Prime Directive, he'd already seen us. The damage was done. It was either bring him aboard or let him die.  
PICARD: Then why didn't you let him die?

Picard, you’re an asshole. I don’t think I need to explain why.

&gt;TROI: Mintakan emotions are quite interesting. Like the Vulcans, they have highly ordered minds. A very sensible people

Oh thank you Troi. What would we ever do without your insights.

&gt;BARRON: Picard, you must beam Palmer aboard immediately. Without medical attention  
PICARD: It's not as simple as that. He is surrounded by Mintakans. If he dematerialises before their eyes, the impact  
BARRON: It will slightly increase the cultural contamination which already exists. A small price for saving Palmer's life.

Barron is of course right. Just seeing an alien was enough to convince the villagers that something outside their experience is going on and the Picard is real. It makes no difference if they see Palmer vanish mysteriously or he vanishes mysteriously without anyone seeing it. And having an alien dead body or prisoner won’t help either.

&gt;PICARD: Number One?  
PICARD \[OC\]: Is there any chance of your freeing Palmer and transporting up unseen?  
RIKER: We can try.  
PICARD \[OC\]: Try hard.

Picard, you idiot.;

&gt;BARRON: Like it or not, we have rekindled the Mintakans' belief in the Overseer.  
RIKER: And are you saying that this belief will eventually become a religion?  
BARRON: It's inevitable. And without guidance, that religion could degenerate into inquisitions, holy wars, chaos.  
PICARD: Horrifying. Doctor Barron, your report describes how rational these people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in the supernatural.

Actually if it was that long ago they wouldn’t even remember they ever had it.

&gt;Now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement, to send them back into the Dark Ages of superstition and ignorance and fear? No! We will find some way to undo the damage we've caused.

Here is the fundamental problem with the episode. The Mintakans have seen something they didn’t comprehend and this has revived religion among them.

Except…

**They live in the Bronze Age**

They see things they don’t comprehend every day. Every time they have an outbreak of infectious disease, or a lightning strike, or a meteor, rain, or the flipping sun rising in the morning they’re seeing something they don’t have an explanation for. Humans in the bronze age invented gods for a reason. They didn’t need alien astronauts to do it.

If the Mintakans don’t believe in gods it’s because unlike humans they don’t have a widespread need for gods. Gods answer questions people aren’t content to leave unanswered. Without that need this “religion” certainly isn’t going to spread beyond the actual eyewitnesses to the weirdness and even the eyewitnesses probably wouldn’t conclude anything more than the basically accurate “there’s a strange round-eared tribe with powers we do not comprehend”.

&gt;PICARD: If you believe I am all-powerful, then you cannot hurt me. If, however, I am telling the truth and I am mortal, you will kill me. But if the only proof you will believe is my death, then shoot.  
NURIA: Liko, don't do it!  
OJI: Father, no!  
(Oji jolts Liko's arm enough to deflect the arrow into Picard's shoulder. Nuria holds up her blood-stained hand to Liko and he bursts into tears)

Picard…you idiot. What do Osiris, Baldr, Herakles, Quetzalcoatl, and Jesus all have in common?

They all have stories *where they die* and are worshipped as gods anyway.

Here’s the thing. The episode from start to finish is tainted with subtle contempt for the Mintakans because they aren’t as technologically advanced as the humans for all of Picard’s pretensions to the contrary. Do you know how Kirk would have handled this problem? He would have beamed down, walked up to the village and said “You have a member of my tribe. Could I please have him back?” He would have explained that his people were nomads who would soon be gone.

The problem would have been solved. But Picard and the Federation didn’t have enough respect for the Mintakans to deal with them as beings just as mentally capable as they are even though they don’t have as many toys. So instead they treat the Mintakans as children who need to be sheltered from any hint of reality and fumble around, making things worse at every turn. It’s an insult to the Mintakan intelligence and to that of the audience.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,271837,public,self,My Rant About Who Watches The Watchers,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kla95k/my_rant_about_who_watches_the_watchers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it is also making it more difficult to think of a more *uplifting* Star Trek episode that might help me escape for an hour or two, while not being so dark.

However, am I the only one who finds it bizarre that weapons don't really seem to have advanced at all, in particular with torpedoes?

We saw Earth use Quantum Torpedoes, however it looks like both Starfleet and the Emerald Chain are still using Photon torpedoes as their standard weaponry. I can just about buy into Quantum Torpedoes being the standard weapon, given it was an advanced new weapon in the late TNG era. You can see how they may have refined that over a few centuries, then engaged in a temporal weapon arms race, before reverting back to conventional weapons (which didn't develop further during the Temporal wars) due to the temporal accords / limited resources.

Photon torpedoes however seemed to have reached their limits in the TNG era, and we know from when Discovery arrived at Starfleet HQ that hull technology has advanced significantly, so its hard to see how these would still be an effective weapon.

As for phasers, at least they've been intentionally more vague, but the effects still look like Star Wars style lasers from the earlier seasons of Discovery, rather than more sophisticated beam style weaponry. It's like they couldn't be bothered to come up with new VFX.

It's rather frustrating, as surely this is a really easy thing for them to get right - just invent some new technobabble weaponry (like they did many times in the TNG era) and don't elaborate on the details, as they have avoided doing consistently so far in Discovery.",False,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,271791,public,spoiler,31st Century Weapons,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kl2u7v/31st_century_weapons/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The psychedelic references and visuals troughout the show.

The fact they even named Paul stamets after one of my psychedelic heroes, namely the real Paul Stamets. (And consulted him) The referenses to psilocybin and visuals of the mycelium network makes it pretty clear the makers of Discovery have seen some psychedelic realms themselves. The show is packed with obvious and hidden psychedelic references. And the Trill episode was simply mind blowing. Reminded me of Ayahuascha. 

Although far fetched, i love the whole mycelium network thing and spore drive. Besides i have loved anything related to time travel and alternative universe. 

Discovery is quicly taking 2nd place in my list, closely behind DS9.

Im sorry, but i find discovery much much better than Picard. I struggled with Micheal 1st season, but now love her. Picard is ok, but i was a bit disappointed on the story line. I really really prefer the post nemesis novel timeline instead, picard is well in my opinion at  least...more Picard. At least Discovery kept some novel references, like section 31 ""Control"".

I was just sad that Star Trek Online was 100% combat and nothing else.

I was more or less expecting to fly through a large open universe, meeting (maybe even procedurally generated) alien races with their own problems, moral dilemmas, transmissions, emergency hailing, logic puzzles, language translation puzzles, first contact, basically a deduction and puzzle game with some combat even!

Internal ship drama, building a crew, customizing uniforms, using the holodeck for mini games or relaxation, exploring the ship on foot; basically a customizable Star Trek RPG powered by procedural generation, roleplaying opportunities and your own choices.

Is there anything like that on the market right now? Even if it is just a game that isn't Star Trek but I can roleplay as Star Trek.

In the approximate month the admiral has known of the discovery its had 3 or 4 incidents of insubordination or refusal of orders, and had already given Saru a warning about his command that led to him making a green ensign 1st officer. From the outside Discovery must seem chaotic and at risk of mutiny. Now we have a situation where the captain backed Tilly to his face and she failed at the first hurdle, which is not just bad for her reputation, its hugely damaging to how competent Saru looks to a 32nd century observer, on top of what looks like pretty sketchy ability to follow basic chain of command stuff.

So in the next episode why isn't the Admiral going to decide enough is enough on board his prize asset and bring the Discovery home for some briefing that turns into demotions for the senior officers and mass reassignment for the crew? Like the federation said when they met, only Starmets is actually needed and refusing the transfers would only show hes right to break up the crew for being dangerously close to mutiny.

Also, disclaimer, I have seen TOS and most of TNG as well as most of the movies. Otherwise, I haven't seen much else and so these arguments mainly apply to TOS and TNG, but can also refer to others. That also means that understandings of ethics from the writers are likely outdated and thus these missteps from my perspective may not be entirely their fault. (Oh and this is all on mobile, so many apologies)

As we know, the use of the Prime Directive (PD) has been pretty inconsistently applied throughout the franchise, but from what I recall, they are nearly always false dilemmas rather than a true moral one. An episode centering around the PD usually centers around the following question: 

Do we interfere with a people's natural progression if it means helping them? 

When we talked about ethics in my classes (I went to grad school for anthropology so it was kinda important), this becomes an issue with two main dimensions: knowledge vs ignorance and life vs cultural purity. 

An episode focusing on PD usually starts the plot where Starfleet notices a problem that the native people have no way of noticing. Let's say, a natural disaster. A ton of the episode is spent with the cast debating 1. Whether to help at all and 2. If the people can be helped... secretly. But the actual people who would be affected almost never get input. It is as if because these people fail to meet arbitrary advancement requirements (space travel), they are treated as if they are incapable of making decisions on their own behalf. 

This is the failing in how PD is treated in such episodes. The various cultures aren't any less intelligent just because they can't go to space. They simply lack access to the same information as Starfleet does. If we applied that to current comparisons, that is like saying that a modern hunter-gatherer is dumber because they can't drive a car (also assuming that if they had access to a car that they would even want to). Flipping that, it would be saying that anyone reading this post is dumb if they don't know how to identify safe and edible plants in the wild. The Inca, a very complex civilization, never developed the concept of the wheel. Did that make them any less intelligent? 

No it doesn't. So why does Starfleet refuse to include them in discussions about their future? 

I'll get back to this, but first let me shift to the second part of the issue: life vs cultural purity. 

Yes, the act of contacting them in order to ask for their input would introduce concepts and technology that they may not be ready for, but this is like the Trolley Experiment. Refusing to take action, resulting in larger loss of life than whatever sacrifices taking direct action would take is not a passive thing. The moment Starfleet notices something will happen, anything they do at that point, even if it is to do nothing, is still a specific choice on their part. If Starfleet truly wishes not to interfere, then they must also completely avoid those people. By observing, they are just setting themselves up to make these choices. If Starfleet truly wanting nature to take its course, they will truly let these people be. But they don't. By observing them, they must accept that sometimes there are negative affects to doing such research. Can't have your cake and eat it too. 

Literally the only reason not to help is because it will mess with the ""natural progession"" of the people in question. But that's... that makes a ton of assumptions. 

If a cultural has any contact with Starfleet, they will just... what? Abandon their own culture and copy Starfleet? That's an incredibly laughable concept, honestly. Not only do people interact with those of other cultures all the time and not just 100% assimilate, but if they find ideas they do genuinely like, what's the harm in holding it back? It isn't like Starfleet is colonizing the planet by saving them from a volcano. They aren't forcing these people to abandon everything they know and love. The native people will adopt what they want and keep what they want. This is the very common phenomenon called transculturation. Ideas are shared between cultures all the time and all cultures involved change in some way because of it. 

Change isn't necessarily a bad thing. So why is it such a big deal in PD episodes? Because looking at it from this perspective makes the whole argument shaky at best. ""If we save them, they will want to copy us. But we want them to be themselves so we won't even give them the choice of letting us help them."" 

Pretty absurd to me. 

So why does this come up a lot in Trek? Honestly, it is an easy way to give a moral dilemma on television. Writers want these characters to be able to have ethical debates, but also want them to be universally loved. So the solution is to paint the issue as more grey than it truly is so that when the characters do make the ""right"" decision, it is hard fought. If they make the ""wrong"" one, then it is more excusable. Win-win for the writers. 

Personally, I think the true ethical debate would be, if after such a culture is contacted, they refuse the help for whatever reason.

Gagh is alien in origin, it did not evolve on Q'onos, but was instead an invasive species of ""blight"" from the Hur'q Homeworld. It is revered in Klingon society because Kahless was the first Klingon to use his weapons as farm tools to grow food from the land instead of relying on a hunter-gatherer way of life to survive. This basically kicked off a ""neolithic revolution"" that was instrumental to the Klingons resisting and eventually ""overthrowing"" the Hur'q.

This theory is a combination of multiple theories:

Assumption 1: The Klingons are a race of Obligate carnivores. They need relatively fresh meat to sustain themselves.

Assumption 2: The Klingons were a slave/game race created by the Hur'q

Conclusion: Gagh is the only real Klingon food that can be mass produced as a staple ""crop"". Prior to its domestication, Klingons were pack hunters with total/local populations too small to effect any real resistance to the Hur'q Invasion due to the basic limits of how needing prey animals to eat the available plant-life before you can eat the animals looses %90 of the total food energy a given area can produce.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,271676,public,self,"Gagh is so revered in Klingon culture because worms are the only thing a species of Obligate carnivores can effectively ""farm""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kkdrqq/gagh_is_so_revered_in_klingon_culture_because/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are some of my beefs:

* They can't just bring back daddy Lorca even though he was my favorite character, they had the perfect opportunity

* I hate that annoying low voice they use to talk to each other. Nobody else is around, why are you whispering?

* The seasons had Burnham having the most focus but now the focus on Burnham has far exceeded previous seasons. Why? She's not the captain. Since when has a Star Trek series focused more on someone that's not the Captain? She's not even the first officer.

* Idiot childish stories, go to a planet to solve a physiological/time travel issue and you just happen to encounter the guardian of forever and it's 1000x more campy than the original TOS episode.

* ""That's rude of you to refer to me as 'She/Her'. You should be able to read minds and tell that I go by 'They/Them'

I have to say it leaves a lot to be desired despite planting the seeds of a good franchise and I felt like doing a write up of what I liked and disliked. It's enjoyable enough, but it's certainly a product of its times.

I'll start off with some things I really like:

* Spock is a great character. When odd stuff happens to make him laugh or show other emotions you actually have a sense that this is unnatural. Probably the best character in the series
* Bones is also pretty great. He's kind of the heart of the Enterprise and even though you don't always agree with his ideas you understand where his opinions come from. I really liked the episode where he got the terminal disease and married the alien woman. I was kinda hoping the two did just go off and have him retire. (What happened to that disease anyway? Dangling plot thread unless I missed something)
* The episode where they test the computer as the new ship controller was actually really funny because it called Kirk out how he always sends himself, Spock, and Bones instead of crewmen like a normal military mission would be. Obviously this is what happens cuz it's TV, but it would make it a bit more realistic if he wasn't the vanguard 24/7.
* Uhura is by far the best female as she actually does important stuff. I recently rewatched an episode of Comicbook Men where her actress visited and it was interesting hearing that she almost quit but was asked to stay by Martin Luther King Jr.
* Young George Takei. That is all
* I also enjoy the general premise of the series, even if it's just to allow for an indefinite episodic storyline

Now let's get into some issues I have with it:

* First, a small complaint I have is the general lack of military-esque things. This is supposed to be a military ship and Checkov has a Beatles bowl cut. I don't know why but that small detail bothers me so much. At least his Russia obsession is amusing. There's also a large lack of competency when people fight on the show, so that's not so fun to watch
* Just about every Kirk/random woman dynamic is annoying and repetitive. The only one I found endearing was his Native American wife/baby momma, and the first few love interests weren't that bad. But most of the latter ones are just intolerable. Most of those episodes can be summarized by ""Kirk and co. find bad people. Kirk seduces alien woman. Betraying the woman saves the day, and they must abandon their spark despite their feelings"". It's so boring and I hate it. Remember that time an alien sabotaged the ship just to makeout with Kirk? Haha.... yeah.......
* American/Earthly parallels. This would have been interesting if it was once or twice. But it's happened like five times and it's so horribly contrived. Also, the intimate detail Kirk had about the cowboy time period was so stupid. Spock I could believe, but that was a pretty ridiculous episode. While we're on the topic, the one with Abraham Lincoln was also not too great. That entire storyline would have been amazing if Lincoln was replaced with a made up galactic or interplanetary war hero/general. But it being an American president is just so so so lazy and frustrating.
* Unsatisfying endings. Some of these episodes just leave you thinking ""So that was it? WTF"". To name a few: the one where Kirk's wife just dies, pretty much anytime they encounter Romulans, when they just let the alien who stole a shuttle go cuz his people were dead, and the episode where Klingons arm some primitive people. That last one in particular was super upsetting, because everything was absolutely unresolved. Did they really just say ""oh well, guess the Prime Directive was right haha"" and leave the planet? That doesn't even make any sense
* The women's outfits. This just bothers me. They're not practical at all, and in the first few episodes it's like some of the women's only job is to attend to the Captain. I don't get this one at all. Also the episode where they're eating dinner and keep telling the ambassador she's beautiful is very.... awkward and plain uncomfortable to be honest.
* Technology like Bones' little scanner is just ridiculous. This is another of those ""product of its time"" things, but I just roll my eyes when he waves it over someone for 2 seconds and makes a thorough medical analysis. The phrase ""He's dead Jim"" will haunt me forever

All in all, I think the series sets up a good universe for the future series and introduces some good characters. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the franchise after I power through the animated episodes next. What is the general consensus on the best series?

A few people told me that season 7’s Shattered was the exception, and I’m happy to say they were right. Shattered is a fantastic episode. 

I think the reason it works so well is because it’s not JUST a Chakotay episode- it’s a Chakotay and Janeway episode. Chakotay’s character works best when he’s interacting with others, and his bond with Janeway is my favorite because they have such a great relationship. Even when separated by 7 years they still are able to bond and trust each other, and that love is shown here so well. 

Shattered also works because it’s an episode that relies on series continuity, which VOY typically lacks. This is the one episode that really rewards you for watching everything and sticking by the series for 7 seasons. 

Side note I’m still bitter they didn’t become a couple- it was already written all you had to do was make it canon writers! This isn’t even a case of the time period because it was a m/f relationship- there was no reason they couldn’t become a thing.

And why the federation would want to ban it.  But what right do they have to impose that ban on the whole galaxy.  And having one law or treaty that says you can't do something no matter the situation is too rigid.  The use of time travel should be judged like prime direction violations.  On a case by case basis.  If the temporal accord had been around in the 23rd century do you think kirk would have sat on his hands and said oh I want to stop earth from being annihilated by an alien probe.  But I can't because of the temporal accord.  Of course not he would have gone back in time anyway.   Why because it is the right thing to do.

But according to the temporal accord kirk should have been immediately thrown in jail.  Even though he didn't alter the timeline.  Then there was that one guy who traveled from the kelvin timeline and into the future.  Who the federation let die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe.  Because of the temporal accord.  When rules and laws becomes so rigid that they are willing to sacrifice people like that then they have become too rigid.  There should be reasonable exceptions for the use of time travel.  

Also does the federation plan on forcing this accord on everyone in the galaxy.  Who gave them the right to do that.  What about aliens who use time travel but with the consent of their people and they don't effect the history of the federation or anyone else.  Are starfleet ships going to show up over their planet and force them to sign the temporal accord.  That would be tyrannical.  That said those who do use time travel as a weapon against others should be dealt with.  And should not be tolerated.  The temporal accord does that by prohibiting time travel regardless of the situation.  Which is way to rigid.  

If the federation can't be reasonable with it's laws and treaties then it should expect members to just outright ignore them and non members to refuse to sign them.  That being said their should time travel watchdogs who track malicious use of time travel while almost ignoring non malicious use of time travel.  And each incident should be judged on a case by case basis.  If they can't do this then they become a tyrannical organization and something that should be opposed. 

Also notice how the federation ignores the temporal accord when it's inconvenient.  If they were to follow it to the letter then discovery's crew would be in the brig.  But they want their spore drive so they let a group of time travlers roam free.  Risking a temporal war if the other factions find out about it.  So they don't even follow the temporal accord when it benefits them to not do so.  But letting a man die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe that didn't benefit them to break the temporal accord so they didn't.  But discovery's spore drive does so they will break the temporal accord to use it.  So they are hypocrites.

So the bottom line is if they can't be sane and judge time travel use like prime directive violations on a case by case basis then they are the bad guys.

But what I think is that the burn isn't the big reveal as we are thought to believe but in fact the federation has been infiltrated by The Chain. The burn happened the same time in another alternate universe where the federation has crumbled but being how admiral Archer has help win the temporal cold war the federation has bought some time to exist. I think in the temporal war the federation has lost badly and as a result this was their ultimate fate to be no more. Some how in this future dilithum would be its down fall, because if they could not destroy earth in the temporal cold war they could destroy what is the federation as a whole. None of its key planets are in it and even so the klingons aren't even mentioned as to which gives hint they too have suffered from a loss of that war being how the Orions are causing havoc. I think someone has helped altered events to make sure the federation would be obsolete but the error they made was dilithum.

Now I Think admiral Vance and Book are working with The Chain and that is why Discovery has been compromised because they have planted devices to help track the ship and its capabilities to Osyraa. How come she knows Discovery has a spore drive? How come she knew where discovery was? Also why has Book been so keen on joining Starfleet? I think Book and Vance was feeding information to her behind their backs. The admiral also has been very hesitant on finding out the cause of their burn.  This also begs the question or even a trip down memory lane as to when Micheal found discovery, Gergiou knew something was up with her and when she beamed back to Discovery she was giving her the cold shoulder. Lets add on to the fact that  Saru and Tilly suspected something off with her when she got back. A year can be a long time, but when you're an adult a year isn't very long to let go on something or someone. I suspect Micheal isn't who she is and she's something else, maybe the Grudge?  

I would also like to add on about what happened to Georgiou, she needed to go back in time because of her time traveling dilemma. She started having her issues as soon as Kovich interrogated her but she also knew something was up with the federation because how could they let something like the burn happen or even figure it out in 125 years? 

Also time travel is banned but who or what is keeping tabs on who or what time travels?  Lets also add who can detect who or what time travel? 

My theory is this, the federation is and was compromised by the chain but they were only able to do to altered events which made the federation lose the Temporal War. Kovich is actually starfleet/section 31 who knew Georgiou needed to be sent back to make sure she can give info on what was the fate of the federation 1000 years from where ever she was sent back to. Also Micheal, Book, and Vance are not who they say they are. I think Discovery has to go back in time again to try and prevent some events from happening because all we know is that The Chain has over taken the federation as whole by next episode.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,271567,public,spoiler,Theories and Speculation in Disco,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kjsq30/theories_and_speculation_in_disco/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we learned that at the center of The Burn is a planet made of dilithium. When the crew sees this somebody (I can't remember who) says something to the effect of ""this would solve the scarcity problem"" and everyone seems to think this solves the dilithium problem. Book even says ""the galaxy just got a whole lot smaller.""

Now obviously this is true... for awhile. But reliance on any non-renewable recourse is inherently a temporary solution. Assuming the entire planet is made of dilithium it should be easy to calculate how long this one planet will last. But consider that The Federation had many dilithium mining planets. And those only lasted about 1,000 years. When you consider that for the early part of that time there were much fewer ships, and the majority of the dilithium was coming from Earth's moon alone for the first 100 years this doesn't seem like a lot. By the time of The Burn the Federation also included Klingon space, and likely Cardassian and Romulan space too. That's a lot of dilithium. And all 350 member wolds spend what, 100 years trying to find an alternative. And only one almost-solution was found that was deemed to dangerous?

And now it's not just the Federation's supply of dilithium, but the entire galaxy's. The Federation is setting itself up to fail. The entire galaxy knows that in X years there will be no more dilithium and everything will go back to the way it was. Even the Spore Drive needs dilithium crystals to carry power.

Now you may say ""but isn't that how our world works right now?"" To which I say yes, it is. And look at where that's been taking us for the past century. How hopeful is the average person about the state of the world in 100 years time? Plus the people of Star Trek have been shown to clearly understand the problems with this kind of dependence. Even in the days of Enterprise.

So my question is, is this planet a solution at all or is it just a 1-200 year temporary fix?

I'm not bitter, I'm just saying the ending of this episode reminded me of TNG's Rascals; except this ep was not as plausible.

I wonder if maybe Discovery shouldn't have found Starfleet HQ, and had been forced to tackle a hostile galaxy with only the Sphere AI and Spore drive as their main advantage.

They later decide to make it into a resort.  By TNG era however people regularly have holodecks so is it still worth it?  

I think it maybe because in some ways is much better.  For one you don't have to program it, the planet just scans your mind for you to create what you want. Also a holodeck program is only as good as the programmer can make it. There maybe flaws that the user sees that the programmer didn't.  You get everything you want on the Fantasy Planet.

However holodecks only act when you program to.  The downside to the fantasy planet is it makes any you think come to life.  Try to clear your mind and you may run into the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man.  Not only that but it isn't just you who generates fantasies.  Anyone you are with or who is already there are doing it as well.  So if someone dreams of a dinosaur watch out.   

In the episode we meet  Yeoman Tonia Barrows who is kinkest person ever to join Starfleet!  Her fantasy is for some medieval knight to show up, fight to win her, kidnap her, and rip her dress off.  She was the only one of this crew to have an abduction fetish, but you get a whole ship load down and I think some really crazy stuff might start happening because it only takes one person to think of it.

___

**Episode 40 - ""Su'Kal""**

* This is the first episode since ""Raijin"", and fifteenth overall, to have a title consisting only of a character's name. Partial matches since then include ""The Trouble with Edward,"" ""Ephraim and Dot,"" and ""Much Ado About Boimler.""
* A portrait of the *USS Clarke* is displayed on the mess room wall; the *Clarke* was destroyed at the Battle of the Binary Stars.
* Nebulae are commonly used by ships to hide from other ships. It's less common that a nebula or nebula-like region is actively harmful or dangerous to vessels, but examples include the McAllister Nebula in ""Chain of Command,"" the nebula in ""One,"" the Briar Patch from *Insurrection,* the Necro Cloud in *Beyond* (the latter two of which also contained planets inside), and the Expanse from ENT's third season. Occasionally a nebula is found to be a living creature, as was the case in ""Bliss.""
* Dr. NotCulber appears to double as a veterinarian to care for Grudge. Dr. Crusher and Dr. Phlox were conscripted into the same role when tending to Spot and Porthos, respectively.
* An inordinate amount of time is spent on the crew worrying about the safety of the away team, as though it weren't a routine part of the job. Picard had to weigh his feelings for Commander Daren against sending her on a dangerous mission in ""Lessons.""
* Tilly cites her ""Granny Adele."" Captain Picard had an Aunt Adele who gained fame for her homeopathic sleep remedies.
* Occasionally away teams are cosmetically altered to resemble native species (""First Contact"" et al.) or to spy on enemies (""The Enterprise Incident"" et al.); Doug Jones' appearance without his heavy makeup evokes ""Far Beyond the Stars"" in which the usually-alien crew appear as humans.
* Holodecks in the 24th century were also capable of projecting custom skins on their users. Later we see the radiation affecting the away team, which is curious since the program would presumably hide all of that; Saru also complains about a human fear of heights, suggesting he is ""actually"" human, but this could just be psychosomatic.
* The holodeck appears to be malfunctioning. This only happened once before, in ""Elaan of Troyius.""
* The recreation of the Kaminar admission ceremony includes two aliens, one who looks like a Saurian with smaller eyes and another with six tentacles protruding from its head and a double Fu Manchu. I would not be surprised if these were more examples of ""use aliens seen in the background of a deleted scene of one movie and see if the nerds notice"" but I am unable to identify them. The Starfleet uniforms and badges are unfamiliar and are likely meant to evoke a random period in Federation history between the PIC era and the Burn.
* Book hypothesizes that Osyraa used a transwarp conduit to find them. Transwarp conduits are hyperspatial corridors used by the Borg to fast-travel across the galaxy.
* It is revealed that *Discovery* now has a cloaking device. In the crew's home century, cloaking technology had not been achieved by the Federation, and in the 24th century the Federation was barred by the Treaty of Algeron from using it except under certain circumstances. With the Romulans now reunified with the Vulcans, it makes sense that the treaty is no longer in effect. It is remarked that the ship cannot spore-jump while cloaked, adding to a list of things cloaked ships can't do for plot convenience.
* Issa created a holoprogram to take care of Su'Kal. This is very similar to the situation in ""Future Imperfect.""
* The theme and motif of the holoprogram felt to me not so much a holodeck episode but more of an ""enter a character's mind"" episode like ""Extreme Measures"" or ""Dark Page."" Out of canon, it also reminded me of 80s fantasy films like *The Dark Crystal,* *Mio in the Land of Faraway* and *Labyrinth* (or, more relevantly, its similarly-named 2006 spiritual successor, which also featured monsters, Doug Jones, and a haunting lullaby).
* Tilly hides behind Sigmund Freud as a defense mechanism. Freud previously appeared in ""Phantasms.""
* Osyraa grabs the *Discovery* with tentacles, as the Pakleds did in ""No Small Parts."" That episode was produced after this one so technically the callback is reversed.

I know that their replicators have been deactivated by that time, but if the chain reaction happens that quickly and affects the whole minefield, how should the whole thing have been able to work at all? One shot would have been enough to cause that massive explosion, and due to the extremely fast chain reaction, there would have been no time for any mine to replicate a new one before it detonates.

That was the last Trek show I hadn’t seen yet! Ok I haven’t seen any cartoons either but - 

Anyway I was frankly not into the first season at all. It was depressing, did not feel like Trek one bit, was overly futuristic for a time period that was supposed to be before TOS, and I didn’t like any of the characters. Plus it was just too complicated, and frankly not a fan of the plot. And don’t get me started on those weird Klingons lol like what was that? Anyway. 

Second season, with the arrival of Pike, and slight change of tone and resolutions of certain discrepancies between the Trek we know and that (Klingons back to normal, tech explanations like holograms etc.) a slightly more positive vibe - I started to get into it. In fact I’m really looking forward to Strange New Worlds!! 

I do miss Lorca though - he was one thing I loved about season 1. I wish they brought back his prime universe version or something. 

Then season 3 arrived and wow... just wow!! The future is incredible and I love that there is just nothing we can say about how it doesn’t fit with the rest of Trek technology wise now because it’s just so far ahead. I love that we’re seeing completely new territory, in a way that makes sense. The tone has gotten SO much more positive and I’m really feeling the true Trek vibes now. So much emotion! So much hope! Okay I’m not done I’m only at episode 6 so don’t spoil but... so far... amazing.

We've seen a few planets that had decent planetary defenses.  The planetary shield and defense grid over earth in discovery was impressive.  But for the most part few planets have planetary defenses.  Why is that?  Considering the federation's history of war and conflict (for an organization devoted to peace they do get into a lot of wars) you would think their member worlds would have planetary defenses.

A planetary defense grid is much cheaper then building a fleet of starships.  Because they don't need warp drive, just a few thrusters to keep them from falling out of orbit, their much smaller then most ships, and they aren't used often so the energy cost is low.  A planetary shield is an even better option if you have the power and technology.  But even without a shield a planetary defense grid can take out a fleet of ships.  

Another option is mines.  Self replicating mines if you have the technology.  You could build the mines in space and when your expecting unwanted guests you could have them maneuver into position or beam them into position.  That way you have several layers of defenses between a fleet of enemy ships and the planet.  Ground to space cannons are also a good option.  So that even if ships get past the orbital defenses they still get blown out of the sky from the cannons on the ground.

Most of these planetary defenses are cheap.  Mines and orbital weapon platforms are easy to build.  A planetary shield would be more difficult but possible.  With the proper planetary defenses you could hold off the entire klingon or romulan fleet.  Maybe even both.  So considering the federation's history of war they should start equipping their member worlds with effective planetary defense systems.  The dominion war would have turned out differently if most federation worlds had effective planetary defenses . The dominon fleet would have been wiped out over batazed instead of conquering the planet.  So the federation really help their member worlds defend themselves better.

No human had ever seen a Romulan before so they didn't know they had the same appearance.  The Romulan commander's appearance was even a surprise to Spock.  It was a major part of the backstory that during the Federation-Romulan war from a century before, there were no visual communications, and they only talked by radio.

What gets me, is that back during ""Enterprise"", Archer's crew had even heard Romulans speak, untranslated.  In the reboot movies, alternate-Uhura could even speak Romulan -- all three dialects of it -- and stated she was about the only human who could distinguish spoken Romulan from spoken Vulcan.

Considering that T'Pol was a native Vulcan, and Sato could also speak Vulcan without the assistance of the UT (which she herself could program, anyway) -- nobody thought to mention that these sight-unseen hostile aliens were speaking a nearly indistinguishable version of a language that was spoken by Earth's only alien allies of the moment?  And the fact of that significant similarity did not get passed down through the war, which was a major inciting incident for the founding of the Federation?

I can say without a doubt she is fierce. She has more growth than most characters in the series, from a ruthless Terran to so much more. Her fierce devotion to her beliefs is what is truly impressive.

The Terran Empire is strong, but is clearly destined to fall. It is evident that with the new and improved Georgiou at the helm, they may have a chance. She proves to be even MORE badass than the Terrans, who simply rely on cruelty as a cop out.

Most importantly, she travelled to a mirror universe, made herself at home, and proved indispensable in the current time, and 900+ years in the future.

But where were the special forces? Does Starfleet not have an equivalent to the SEALs? Okay, so it was some highly classified material. But spec-ops guys have high clearance for exactly that reason.

Or is Star Trek just much harder to depict in a video game setting vs SW's hack-slash-and-shoot straightforwardness?

Or because of CBS? / Paramount? (sorry I still don't quiet get who really owns the Prime Universe of Star Trek) have some prohibitive licensing rules that make development difficult?

I am aware of some of the old games, but I believe none of them stirred much attention at all.

I'm watching DS9 for the first time, having caught sporadic episodes of next generation on tv and seen a number of the movies. In DS9 they rarely announce set phasers to stun, or to kill, so in action scenes it's hard to tell are they killing, stunning, tickling or what?

Specifically in one episode (I just started season 3, so first two seasons spoilers- fairly mild) Kira and Obrien raid a cardassian prison camp and shoot multiple guards. Being in open combat, I assumed these guards were killed. Later in the episode tribunal, O Brien stated he has not killed any Cardassians since the war. Is he lying, or had he genuinely stunned the guards? How long does a stun last? I understand the diplomatic reasons to stun rather than kill, but isn't it tactically risky?

My other reason for asking is if you're being shot at, do you have any ability to determine the level of firepower you're being hit with? short of checking vitals on someone who has been hit, do you have any indication whether their weapons are set to lethal mode?",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,271268,public,spoiler,"Is There Any Way To Tell a Phasers Setting?

If you haven't watched it lately (It was my first time today), the basic premise is that there is an androgenous race that has no genders since in the past the have ""evolved"" to be a single gender. However, some people are still born with gender tendencies such as male/female feelings and identities. These people are hunted down, socially punished, and ostracized until they publicly admit that they are non-gendered like everyone else. One such person self identifies as female, and she is put on trial for it. Some very interesting quotes arising from that scene:

Sorin: ""I am tired of lies. I am female. I was born that way. I have had those feelings, those longings all of my life. It is not unnatural. I am no sick because I feel this way. I do not need to be helped. I do not need to be cured. What I need, and what all of those who are like me need, is your understanding and your compassion. We have not injured you in any way, and yet we are scorned and attacked, all because we are different. What we do is no different from what you do. We talk. And laugh. We complain about work, and we wonder about growing old. We talk about our families and we worry about the future. and we cry with each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you do with each other, that is what WE do. And for that, we are called misfits and deviants, and criminals. What right do you have to punish us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can dictate how people love each other?""

The response?
""I congratulate you Sorin. Your decision to admit you perversion makes it much more likely that we can help you.""

Engaging a superior enemy with one ship when you know they have backup on the way is foolish.  I know they were trying to protect federation planets.  But the best way they could defend the federation is to fall back and regroup.  Even if civilians get massacred in the long run they would be in a better position to win the war.  Leaving a few colonies undefended is better then losing the entire federation.  The best approach is to fall back to the federation core worlds and defend them with most of their ships.    Let the klingons come to them.  There are advantages to adopting a siege mentality when faced with a superior force.  With less territory to defend they would have a much stronger perimeter.  They would be leaving many federation worlds out to be massacred but in the long run it's the best strategy to win the war.,True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,271264,public,self,Starfleet's tactics at the battle of the binary stars was inept.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/khslos/starfleets_tactics_at_the_battle_of_the_binary/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also I have to wonder if she would have been punished if she had fired and the klingons backed off.  If someone were to mutiny and stop a war would they still be thrown in the brig.  Regardless you have to give burnham credit.  She mutinied knowing it would ruin her career.  Because she beloved it was the right thing to do.  She didn't mutiny for selfish reasons.

My son has been really anxious for a number of reasons during these covidy times, so (at his request) I started reading to him again before bed. We hit a couple of sci-fi novels, and he likes Trek. Any Trek series he might enjoy?  We started to read the Vanguard series (he picked it off Amazon because he likes TOS), but it meanders a bit (it being the first of a series, I guess) and adult themes (namely a couple of adult relationships and the Vulcan officer who was sexually traumatized). I can skip over some of that (you don't want your dad reading it to you), but it gets tough to edit on the fly, particularly when it is integral to the plot.

As I have stated before I am watching Voyager for the first time from beginning to end. I am on Season 7 episode 15 ""Workforce, Part 1"".

The Doctor as the Emergency Command Hologram is Bad Ass! It is really smart to have that programed for him and only the commanding officers can activate it. As much as Tuvok and Seven of Nine are superior assets to the crew, the Alpha Omega Super Saiyan of the crew is the doctor. Like when the whole crew had to be in statis pods for like 2 months and only Seven and the doctor had to get them through. I feel he is the equivalent of Data is for Enterprise. 

When Voyager gets back, the Federation needs to research how effective Holograms are and what they can do for not just Sick Bay, but the whole ship. They could get small research vessels with only Holograms and go into Nebulas or other harmful to humans parts of space and scan to find new information. I forsee the ability of having a skeleton crew of human and the rest Holograms, at least on my ship. Plus, if they get boarded, just make 100 Klingons or Borg or Hirogen Holograms to fight the intruders. It's not like they can be shot or hurt. 

Thoughts? I am aware that there is that beam that gets rid of Holograms, but you could modulate the shields ahead of time to stop that, knowing that would erase your crew. Also, I am aware of the glitches, but the Doctor is a model 1 Holograms, not intended for all he does.

After all, its not even clear what governments still existed in the 2060s post WW3 and to what extent their writ ran and communications were possible. For example, did the Vulcans have to effectively reconnect the chaotic remnants of the world themselves-did they have to do multiple first contacts with multiple governments (and if so did they all go peacefully or did Vulcan have to disarm some human militaries?) and where they didnt exist, assist in reconstituting some governments on a provisional basis-effectively rebuilding and uniting an entire world from scratch, is something of a tall order even for an advanced society like Vulcan.

Let me start by acknowledging the controversial nature of this view within the hardcore geek community, but I encourage a spirited debate. Although I’ll concede that Star Trek and The Next Generation (TNG) adhere to the same general naval exploration theme with predictable plots and outcomes (both series were written and directed by Gene Roddenberry), I find that the rest of the franchise does much to break this mold. **Disclaimer - There are naturally several ""spoilers"" in the article to follow.**

Starting with Deep Space Nine (the first series after Roddenberry’s death) we see a significant departure from the previous Star Trek model. DS9 largely abandons the naval theme of the previous series and explores the concept of the Castle Doctrine (the military principle of projecting strength from a central base or port). At the time of DS9's release, most American military experience and doctrine was focused on strength through maneuver rather than castle doctrine. It wasn’t until the Global War on Terror (GWOT) that most Americans intuitively understood the principles of fighting from centralized bases. The series also dedicates much of the story line to exploring the ideas of asymmetric warfare and insurgency. In the years before GWOT, these concepts were generally unexplored within US media making the show almost prophetic. Lastly, DS9 was also the first Star Trek series with any meaningful exploration of the subject of religion (Roddenberry was an avowed atheist and considered religion to be largely superstition). I found Captain Sisko's journey from disbelief in his own role in the Bajoran religion to his eventual acceptance of the 'Prophets' to be extraordinarily insightful.

The next series in the franchise was Voyager and it largely expands on the moral dilemmas introduced in DS9. We see that the Prime Directive is no longer sufficient to provide guidance in a gritty and honest plot line. We find the crew of Voyager struggling with the morality of doing the wrong thing for the right reason and sacrificing the good of others for the sake of self-preservation. I found the early theme of cultural interference to be fascinating. The crew of Voyager are faced with the eternal decision of helping a developing society or allowing them to suffer through the natural evolution of their circumstances. This can be seen in parallel to several modern geo-political situations that we find ourselves in today. Very insightful and thought provoking situations resulting in no right decision, but many wrong ones. I found the alliance with the Borg late in the series to be a believable and interesting take on ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" situation and reminiscent of the forced alliance between the American and Soviet militaries in WWII. I also find Captain Janeway's character to be the most fully articulated Star Fleet captain of the franchise to date.

Next came Star Trek Enterprise; easily my favorite series in the Star Trek Universe. For the first time, we see a meaningful exploration into the limitations that logistics impose into military maneuver and operations. Most military leaders acknowledge that logistics is often the difference between success and failure on the battlefield, but up until this point, the writers of Star Trek had largely ignored the subject (I recognize that Voyager did explore this subject to a limited extent, but Enterprise made it a more regular theme). We also see an interesting take on anti-imperialism in the human resentment of the Vulcans for “holding them back.” This can be paralleled to US efforts to influence/shape other nations yet keep them reliant on American support. Lastly we see Captain Archer spend his entire life trying to escape his father’s legacy only to discover in the end that he himself is the pivotal historical figure that all humans (and the Federation in general) will later immortalize.

Please feel free to add to the discussion.

I'm totally new to Trek and really want to dive in and watch it all. I also thought it would be fun to run a podcast, so I'm discussing hosting one with a friend and chatting about each episode as I go.  


As someone who knows next to nothing about Trek (and is trying to avoid spoiling anything) I'm just wondering if anyone has a suggestion for a show logo. My idea was to call it Cadets, referencing Starfleet Cadets, and to have the logo/banners visually reference Trek cadets in some way. From a quick Google image search though, I couldn't find anything that specifically identifies cadets; in TNG it seems as though they share the same red colour as the command folks.  


So my question is, can anyone point me to a colour scheme/insignia from any Trek generation (although earlier is preferable) where someone familiar with Trek would see it and say ""oh that's the cadet colours/symbol from the \_\_\_\_ series"". Does something like this exist? It wouldn't even need to be a Starfleet cadet, that's just my initial idea. If there is an example of another race or organization with a recognisable symbol for students, that's cool too.  


It's 4am here so I'll be sleeping as soon as I post this; if there are any questions I'll get to them when I wake up.

As far as I remember, it was a shareware game included in the usual 1990s CD-ROM of ""50+"" or ""256!"" shareware/freeware games one could find. 

It was, IIRC, an unofficial Star Trek DOS adventure game that was in first person, reminiscent of TOS or TAS in graphics. However, the first puzzle of the game was simply to find a way to leave the room and I never did, so I would just look around the room and get foiled by the single door and then quit the game.

I figured at the time my computer was incompatible for some reason so I could not find ordinary controls, or my intuition was terrible or it was an ""escape room"" involving a Scotty-like cutting of the wall to hack the door mechanism.

So I’ve been obsessed with TNG my whole adult life and, like most of you, I admire Captain Picard. Patrick Stewart is magnificent in this role and I’ve always looked at Picard as the father I always wanted instead of my back woods, gun loving father. 

That being said, I finally took the plunge and tried another Star Trek series, namely Voyager, and holy shit, Janeway is all over every mission. She’s on away missions, she’s working with the engineer to find a solution to the problem at hand, she comes up with ideas during their group sessions she’s all over the fucking place. And I gotta say, I’m here for it. 

When going back to watch an episode of TNG, Picard comes off as lazy by comparisons. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not throwing any shade because Picard will always be an iconic figure in my life, it’s just amazing to me that I never realized how little he actually did when the time came. 

Anyways, I found it pretty funny to compare the two and I love them both for who they are. Can’t wait to continue with Voyager! I don’t know why I let it take me so long.

Does that sound familiar? The new Trek movies in JJ era aren't as bad as ST but they leave a lot to be desired. And the new shows are worse.

What Mandalorian did was show that 'old school' storytelling, characters, heart, vision and passion, can still work. 

Most importantly, it was done by people who know SW and care about it.  Its not a show created by hacks like Kurtzman, and written by a room of writers whose goal is to stuff it full of every modern cliche and tick every PC box. Again, \*exactly\* like how the new ST movies were done.

JJ movies/DSC/PIC are the equivalent of what JJ/Kennedy/Riann did to StarWars - best forgotten.

Mandalorian IS StarWars, it evokes the same feelings. We need a Trek show with the values of Trek - hope, exploration, optimism.

TOS: Spock (I’m not adding AOS because they’re movies and also because Spock would still be my favourite). 

TNG: Data (he’s awesome and I love him. That’s all there is too it.)

DS9: Odo and Bashir (they’re joint because I adore them both, plus it’s sooo hard to choose just one fave from DS9). 

Voyager: Shamefully, I still haven’t watched Voyager yet, so I don’t know. It’ll probably be the Doctor, but I don’t know yet. 

Enterprise: Phlox (he’s so weird and odd and I love it). 

Discovery: Saru (this is gonna be a long one so buckle in.

Comes with a display base that plays the opening monologue and Star Trek theme. Strangely, it is not the voice of Shatner.

In Sarek’s first scene with Kirk, Sarek really pushes Kirk to take Spock’s body to Vulcan. He says things like “you denied his future” “all Vulcans do this” etc. He culminates this speech by rallying Kirk to Genesis, imploring him to find any way to do it.  

This is not how I remember the scene at all. In my memory, Kirk was desperate for anything that could bring back Spock. Sarek was much more incredulous about Kirk’s chances to save Spock, even commenting on the antiquity and rarity of the whole Katra thing. The scene I recall was Kirk pulling information from Sarek and denying all logic to save Spock.

The whole series so far has felt like a children's show. Even during the more boring parts of the other series, I still enjoyed the characters enough to stick with them. I don't find any of the characters in DS9 to be interesting in the least.

I feel like DS9 has also almost ruined the Bajoran-Cardassian conflict, which I actually found interesting in TNG.

In the latest episode, Georgiou is sent to an unspecified time when the Mirror and Prime Universes were not that far apart. Given narrative in the rest of Discovery indicates there hasnt been a crossing in over 500 years (speaking from the 31st century), and given that the majority of documented crossings span the 22nd century (Enterprise) the 23rd century (TOS and DIS) and the 24th century (TNG, DS9), then it seems plausible that this 200 year period is the target setting for the new Section 31 show starring Georgiou.

What is your preferred time and event?

Personally, i think the new show should effectively act as the sadly never made season 5 of Enterprise, which as the build up set in season 4 makes clear, was supposed to chart the opening of the Earth-Romulan war. Afterall, war settings are generally the best use of a spy agency in a dramatic setting, 

It also gives the show the chance to go into detail about the politics and machinations behind the founding of the Federation which happened as a direct result of the war.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270971,public,spoiler,Preferred setting for the new Section 31 show?,0,[],0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kg5g9p/preferred_setting_for_the_new_section_31_show/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just for the hell of it.  And I watched an episode in season two where they find a planet fifty thousand light years away with humans who were brought there hundreds of years ago by what they called the red angel.  Which just turned out to be a time traveler.  And I noticed how easily primitive people are fooled by advanced technology.  They saw them beam up and thought they were gods.  It just shows how easy it is to fool primitive people who haven't seen technology.  We don't have transporter tech but a lot of people if they saw someone disappear into thin air they wouldn't just assume they were a god.  If we saw a hundred foot jesus in the sky we wouldn't just assume that it's really a deity.  Holograms have been in science fiction for decades and the government has secretly been developing that tech.  

But primitive people can't conceive of technology that can make someone disappear or project a hundred foot jesus into the sky.  So they are really easy to fool.  It makes me wonder how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating the major religions.  Because that is what happened in that episode.  They saw a time traveler with advanced tech and thought it was an angel.  You can fool primitive people with parlor tricks like that.  But you can't fool a technological civilization.  Even a primitive one.  So how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating religion.  Just something to think about.  Honestly I'm surprised that in star trek the federation doesn't deal with more prime directive violations like that.  Someone could land on a primitive planet and pose as a god.  I'm surprised it's not a common occurrence.

I'll try to keep it as Spoilerfree as I can. Except for Lower Decks, Picard Episode 3 onwards, Short Treks Episode 6 onwards and Voyager Episode 26 onwards, Because I haven't seen them yet and I can't spoil anything what I haven't seen, right? 😂

Also, it could be that I've more, I just don't know if my Opinion is Controversal. And don't name every trek-specific controversal opinion, because I have too much. (I'm easy to Impress)

Anyway let's Start:

**The Original Series**

I think it's Definetly Controversal to Say, that I really like the Alternative Factor. In my Opinion it's a Great Story. implementing an Entire Universe, Called the Anti-Matter Universe and we see some interesting dynamics between the trekverse (?) and this universe, What I really Like.

Also, Most People think Turnabout Intruder is the Worst TOS Episode. Why? In my Opinion it's the Best of Season 3 and also one of the Best TOS Episodes. It has a great and Unique Idea, that the Captain is no longer the Captain, because he was... Possessed (?) Ok I don't know the word in English, because I'm not english, but hopefully you Understand What I mean. And this allows also for a Interesting Dynamic between Kirk (the ""Ghost"" of him) and Kirk (the woman in the body of kirk).

And lastly City on the Edge of Forever is the worst Episode Ever (Joke)

**The Animated Series**

Idk if it's that controversal, but when I go by the IMDB Score there's definetly a Difference. So I name the 2 Episodes, but I wouldn't call them Something Special. I kinda Enjoy Bem and The Magicks of Megas-Tu. But I can't tell why. Except for Yesteryear, More Tribbles More Troubles, The Series Finale and the named Episodes is this Series Awful, so I have nothing more to Say.

**Movies 1-6**

The Only Realy Controversal Opinion is that I think Wrath of Khan is just Alright, because Khan is annoying and feels like no threat at all. I think it's annoying that Kirk being an Admiral, and Kirks son is also annoying, like Project Genesis.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270945,public,self,"Unpopular Opinions - How would other fans React to mine?

Just sharing something here because it's wholesome. Me and my sister grew up together watching the very occasional episode (I was 8 and she was 6 when TNG first aired in our country) aided by our mum, who was secretly a big ol' nerd and would insist that we kept Trek on if we ran across it while channel hopping. I think my first memory of the show is the bit in The Naked Now when Data is putting the chips back in the board super fast.

I started really paying attention in high school around DS9's later seasons, and for some reason my sis ended up watching a lot more TNG than I did. As we grew into adults I mainly stuck to many of my nerdy pursuits, going on a more tech-fuelled life trajectory and she broadened her horizons with travel, languages and teaching. But it always stayed as a running joke that any time she was stuck, she'd think ""What would Captain Picard do?"" (or ""what would Snoop Dogg do"" , but that's another story).

We're super tight - best friends, and in lockdown, FINALLY, I got her to give DS9 a try. This is after years of me going ""seriously, it's serialised, it's complex, nobody's purely good or evil, you'll love it. Worf is in it!"" and her going ""I believe you, I'm sure it's great, but I love TNG so much, it's what I grew up with, I'd feel like I was cheating on TNG if I got into DS9""

Well, one of the stations she watches started airing the whole run, and she's tried it. And she LOVES it. In her words ""I think I might be able to be... er... polytrekerous"". She's already latched onto Father Of The Year Benjamin Sisko, and spotted how if something bad's gonna happen to someone, it's gonna happen to Miles Edward O'Brien. Her favourite characters are Odo and Quark (no change from the few episodes she saw as a little kid, then), and as of the writing of this post she's up to the Past Tense two parter.

Last night I completed the series and I am really stunned by the experience. Having never finished the series as a kid, there was so much I hadn't seen before, and so much I hadn't remembered. There's a lot the criticize, but the show is easily one of the best I've ever seen--there's a magic to it that gives it so much staying power. 

Here's some quick and largely unoriginal thoughts:

* I watched it in production order and I feel it was definitely the right decision. It created a sense of continuity in watching the show develop in a linear way. There's a degree of character development that comes from the actors growing into their characters

* Expanding on that,  I swapped the order of the last 2 episodes so that it ended with All Our Yesterdays. Another good decision imo--it's a stunning episode and as Kirk-Spock-McCoy story it makes for a fitting ending

* Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are the heart of the show and their relationship is of its consistent strengths. It's less of an ensemble show than I remember. I've seen it mentioned before, but it wasn't something I noticed when I was younger

* Spock is the best character. Kirk is a great captain and isn't the womanizing swashbuckler he's portrayed as in pop culture and in the Kelvin films

* Season 3 isn't that bad. The budget cuts are obvious and you can tell that they ran out of money at the end there, but overall I loved most of it. When it's at its best, it has some of the series' highest moments. It's uneven and suffers more from being underdeveloped and underfunded than being outright bad. Not to say it doesn't suck donkey balls sometimes. I was genuinely surprised overall

* Favorite episode: The Enterprise Incident
 * Other favorites (in no order): Mirror, Mirror, A Piece of the Action, The Menagerie, All Our Yesterdays, Journey to Babel, Metamorphasis, Arena, Where No Man Has Gone Before, Dagger of the Mind, I, Mudd, A Private Little War, The Savage Curtain, The Tholian Web, 

* Least favorites (again, no order): The Alternative Factor, Catspaw, The Apple, The Gamesters of Triskellion, Miri, Tomorrow is Yesterday, The Paradise Syndrome, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield, Whom Gods Destroy, The Mark of Gideon, Turnabout Intruder, The Way to Eden, That Which Survives, The Omega Glory

Overall this was a truly amazing experience and I'm so excited to inevitably rewatch it a thousand more times. I'm beginning TAS now, which I also saw about half of about a decade ago, so it'll be like watching it for the first time. I've heard good things about Star Trek Continues so I might have to give it a watch too (as well as throw in some New Voyages/Phase II because it was really important to me as a kid). Then I'll be onto the movies which I've seen countless times and then onto TNG, which I've seen maybe 25 episodes of, and then the other 6 (😳) shows--so I've got a lot ahead of me lmao.

Watching this episode for the first time just made me question how dumb Worf and Jadzia really are. Worf has always been kind of the punching bag in TNG as the dumb brute who always had his ideas shot down, but in DS9 he was suppose to be taken more seriously. But in Change of Heart, there was nothing more stupid than what had happened.

They're on their way to rendezvous with a Cardassian spy. Walking 20KMs through dense jungle behind enemy lines.

Jadzia gets shot about 7KMs into the journey by some Jem'hadar, and is steadily bleeding from her wound. Instead of telling her to turn around and go back to the Runabout to get rest and/or treat herself, with Worf venturing out to the rendezvous point on his own, he drags her with him for the next 13KM trip. What was his plan here? Have her go with him to get the spy, and then walk another 20KMs back to the Runabout? If the first 13KM didn't kill her, the second 20KMs definitely will. This is on top of both of them constantly having to delay and rest to tend to her wound. Just the worst strategy ever.

I know this episode is suppose to demonstrate how deep their love is but all it demonstrated to me is how bad Worf is at tactics and strategy.  
At the end of the episode Sisko tells Worf he will probably never get his own command (even though he does command the Defiant multiple times after this event) I completely agree that he should never be in charge of people.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270863,public,self,What was Worf's plan in S6E16 Change of Heart?,0,[],0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kfgxkp/what_was_worfs_plan_in_s6e16_change_of_heart/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- Let the Discovery jump back to this Station with her Spore Drive and Deliver this Gate

- The other Side is at the Mobile HQ so they also Receive one SB-19 Gate 

- Et Voila! Of course they first send only Robot Ships to starting fixing the Station and do Space Wreaks cleanup to make it save for Ships

- SB-19 Travel-route done

or other solution

- Let Discovery repair the needed Subspace Relays to get in contact with the Station

- If they succeed in making contact they are not Home yet.

- If Communications and Data link is established, they could Try something out

- Someone invent some sort of 3D Printer with an Data link trough this communication Line

- Yes, some sort of remote controlled 3D Printer. 

- Discovery could deliver this Platform as well and all they need to run it up

- They ""teleport"" the Robot Drones trough this solution. For Humans this is still to risky

- They Fix the Station and do the Cleanup until the Mobile HQ can visit it in real

Sure, if they could right away teleport Humans trough this, then they also could directly get the Trans warp Device out of the Bin or even build an Bigger one to Teleport entire Ships, no Spore Drive is needed.

**Episode 39 - ""Terra Firma, Part 2""**

* Mirror Burnham admits there is a coalition forming to destroy the Terran Empire. This coup was explored during DIS' first season. A rebellion was attempted a century earlier during the events of ""In a Mirror Darkly,"" and after Georgiou's time the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance would finally succeed in bringing the Empire down.
* Among the races Mirror Burnham tattles on is the Denobulans. This is the first direct reference to Dr. Phlox's race outside ENT (there was a mention of Denobulan bacteria in LD), although this is the Mirror Universe and they may be classified as a distinct species. The Mirror Denobulans were established in ""In a Mirror Darkly"" as a subservient race within the Empire.
* The opening credits are vertically flipped and chromatically inverted, representing the episode's setting in the Mirror Universe. This is a nod to the ""Mirror Darkly"" arc in ENT, whose Mirror episodes featured a darker opening sequence.
* Among the *ISS Discovery's* crew is Mirror Airiam (who was also seen last week but missed by me), as a full Terran and not a cyborg. Other than Georgiou herself, the only other notable Mirror character seen to be alive after her Prime counterpart was killed is Jennifer Sisko (noting of course that this episode still takes place before Prime Airiam dies).
* Georgiou watches Mirror Burnham's agony session through a monitor enclosed in her wall. This is likely a Tantalus field, a weapon that can remotely disappear anyone from a distance. Mirror Kirk possessed a Tantalus field and ""Mirror Mirror"" implied that it was not a common tool within the Empire.
* Georgiou plants seeds of ""another way of doing things"" in Mirror Saru's ear; the same tactic was used by Kirk to convince Mirror Spock to make a change in ""Mirror, Mirror."" That change, of course, eventually led to the Empire's collapse.
* This is the first on-screen appearance of the vacation hotspot Risa in the NuTrek era. Unlike any of its other appearances, it is here depicted with rings.
* This episode carries on a Mirror Universe tradition of indiscriminately killing off alternate versions of major characters.
* Other than the main headline, the rest of the content of Carl's newspaper is the same as last week. Items not previously logged by me include ""Andorian Famine Contained"" (not a known reference) and the edition of the paper as ""Vol. MMMCLXXXVIII,"" or 3188. Notably the correct present-day date should be 3189, as it took Burnham a year to find *Discovery.*
* We learn that Georgiou experienced three months within the span of a minute. A number of characters have done speedruns of dreams or hallucinations, perhaps the most famous being Jean-Luc Picard instantly serving a twenty-year prison sentence in ""Blink of an Eye.""
* Carl uses the phrase ""a mirror universe,"" the first canon use of that term.
* Carl then goes ahead and reveals himself to be the Guardian of Forever, a temporal sentry introduced in ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" returning in ""Yesteryear,"" and curiously not seen again before June 28, 2018. To this point the Guardian was only known to exist on one unnamed planet in the Alpha Quadrant.
* The Guardian's real voice is taken from ""City,"" and is that of Bart LaRue, who provided a number of ""Non-Corporeal Being of the Week"" voices during TOS.
* Book solves the technical dilemma using subspace relays, a common doohickey inserted wherever there are problems with subspace communications over long distances.
* Georgiou is randomly thrown back in time in a transparent contrivance to set up her own spinoff. A similar device was used in another backdoor pilot, ""Assignment: Earth,"" where the *Enterprise* just kinda showed up in the past so it could meet Gary Seven. A morally ambiguous character magically escaping the main story could also describe Loki in *Avengers: Endgame* (Loki himself is getting his own spinoff), and speaking of ""Endgame,"" Trek has an even longer history of using time travel for dubious narrative purposes.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270769,public,spoiler,"Canon References - ""Terra Firma, Part 2"" [Spoilers]",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/keww4a/canon_references_terra_firma_part_2_spoilers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;THE MILKY WAY - Her Imperial Highness, Mother of the Fatherland, Overlord of Vulcan, Dominus of Qo’noS, Regina Andor, Emperor Philippa Georgiou Augustus Iaponius Centarius has a choice to make.  
&gt;  
&gt;The long just reign of the venerated Terran emperor has begun its final act and Her Magnificence is the only soul strong enough to decide: How will she live? And How will she die?  
&gt;  
&gt;If the Emperor chooses life, it will be away from her beloved Empire, with no hope of return. She will be without her adoring subjects and the fortunate few whom the Emperor has allowed to know her personally. She will not know when or where she is destined, but Her Highness is unafraid because Her Highness fears nothing.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the Emperor chooses death, \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Imperial scientists believe the sensation would be a pain similar to multiple stabbings with dull, flaming machetes while suffering third-degree chemical burns and hemlock poisoning, and then being left to be eaten alive by desperate, greedy, starving wild animals.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Emperor's strength, power, speed, pose, intelligence, beauty, tactical skills, political mastery, wealth, stealth, wisdom, and resilience allowed her to accrue great power and influence across the galaxy. No one has survived so long or so well as Her Majesty in a hostile universe.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Emperor is the smartest genius in the galaxy. There is no one smarter, and there never will be. Therefore, whatever fate the Emperor chooses, her choice will be correct, for herself and for the Empire. And thus the Emperor's reign will have ended, and the Empire will mourn her loss.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Empire reminds all loyal citizens that the Empire continues. The Empire outlives the Emperor. Conserving allegiance to the Empire brings honor and prosperity. Disloyalty to the Empire is punishable by death. Failure to be seen properly mourning the Emperor is punishable by demotion, imprisonment, enslavement, or death.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Emperor's successor will be named at the end of the battle royale concluding the ten-day program on the throne world, marking the official end of the Imperial grieving period. Participation is mandatory for all \[...\]

&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - Starfleet Command today disclosed that the starship U.S.S. Jenolan, and all hands and passengers aboard, has officially been reported missing by senior officials.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Jenolan, bound for the colony on Norpin V, did not reach its destination, Norpin colony authorities, following Federation protocol, reported the Jenolan conditionally overdue six hours after the scheduled arrival time. Once the Jenolan was declared officially overdue, a standard retracing of the vessel's sublight path was undertaken. Norpin officials and Starfleet Command, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, report no debris were found, and no natural or unnatural signs of conventional weapons or known destructive phenomenon was detected.

DS9 shows more of the screens to the audience than TNG did. We see a lot more video and animations on the DS9 computers than we did on the TNG ones. The result is that DS9 computers look have a 1990s look to them, but somehow, TNG doesn't. This makes me wonder how the technology in shows like Discovery will look 30 years from now.

My 2020 Definitive Ranking of Every* Star Trek Series** From Worst to Best!

Before I begin, you may be asking, ""Why?"" Well, as it turns out, eliminating almost all social or external activity for about 9 months gives you an incredible amount of time to watch*** literally every episode of Star Trek. Plus, most of them were added to Netflix this year, so that made it pretty easy to just hit play.

Now, let's get to the list:

Ranked from worst to best based on modern watchability:

8.Enterprise (2001-2005)

7.The Original Series (1966-1969)

6.Voyager (1995-2001)

5.Discovery (2017 - present)

4.The Next Generation (1987-1994)

3.Picard (2020 - present)

2.Lower Decks (2020 - Present)

1.Deep Space 9 (1993-1999)

I can hear you say, ""How dare you rank X series at Y place!"" I will discuss each series in detail below, so you can review my reasoning. Also, this is based on my opinion, and you can feel free to disagree in the comments.
You may also wonder if my opinions were biased by the order in which I watched the series, to which I say, sure, that's entirely possible. Here's the order I watched them, starting in February and ending today: TNG - DS9 - Voyager - Picard - Lower Decks - TOS. Discovery was watched concurrently with several series, as it was released.

Series comments:

Deep Space 9: DS9 might be the most non-standard Star Trek that was ever released, and it quickly became my favorite. Not only were the characters complex and well developed, the scripts were unique, the storylines were a nice combination of episodic and serialized, and its themes continue to hold up. It was heartbreaking, funny, exciting, thought-provoking, and world-building. It was just the best combination of everything you'd want from Star Trek. If you were to go watch one series, this is the one I recommend. 

Lower Decks: The most-recently debuted, and only the second animated series, Lower Decks might seem like an underdog for the top rankings, but for someone whose media consumption has been steeped in Star Trek, I was the exact target audience. Literally every line of the script is dripping with reference and nostalgia, combined with some universally appreciable comedy. This isn't going to be for everyone, but it has been one that I have thoroughly appreciated.

Picard: This is where the list starts to get tough, and I could absolutely see Picard, TNG, and Discovery moving around in my ranking as more episodes are released. Picard has only one season so far, but that season was one of the most well-produced serialized seasons I've seen. It had a nice balance of nostalgia and new storylines. It continued the trend towards darker and more dramatic sets, and I hope future seasons continue the trend.

The Next Generation: I'll admit, this is the series that had the most nostalgia for me, though I was too young to have watched it while it aired. TNG undoubtedly kicked off the second era of Star Trek, which was what I grew up on. To be honest, I had this ranked higher before I watched TOS. I once read a criticism of TNG that so many of its scripts were just re-skinned TOS scripts, and, unfortunately, that was pretty true. Especially for the first 1.5 seasons, and for a large number of exploration-related episodes. That being said, TNG's uniqueness were in the episodes that were similar to Deep Space 9. TNG's Enterprise was a ship of diplomacy, as opposed to exploration, and contained families and more complex relationships, and that led to a much more well-developed feel for the series.

Discovery: TNG and Discovery are probably the closest between any two series on this list. They are both good, for different reasons. Discovery is the first Star Trek series to make a full transition from an episodic to a serialized format, and while its first season may have had some isolated storylines, most of the show follows a single thread. The characters are great, and the story is pretty good, though the visuals definitely draw from the Kelvin timeline Star Trek films (read: lens flares), which is not necessarily a bad thing. The 3rd season is currently airing, and it is certainly the best so far, though it also portrays a very different world, that is characterized by its scarcity. Ultimately, I think it's very possible that the series will rise above TNG, but I think only time will tell.

Voyager: This show suffered from living in the shadow of TNG. Unfortunately, I think the transition from the plentiful Federation of TNG to the stark shortage of resources in Voyager just felt too different. The series was good, and some of its characters stand out as Star Trek all-stars, and Janeway is probably the most under-rated captain. It's stories weren't particularly unique, for the most part, and most of the show suffered from the largest downside of TNG, rehashing old themes.

The Original Series: For some, this will be the most controversial part of my list. I can hear it already, ""it was good for it's time."" Here's the problem: This isn't the 1960's anymore. In one sentence, it was sexist, campy, tired, on-the-nose, groundbreaking, and did I mention sexist? Listen, I watched every* Star Trek series that's ever been made, and I made this list based on which series I think people should watch today, not by time-traveling back to when the show first aired. It doesn't hold up as well as many wish it did, and most of the ""best"" TOS wasn't actually in the 3 seasons that aired, but in the films, which I am not including in my rankings**. 

Enterprise: Most of the people that say they liked this series, are confusing it, because of its name, with TOS. Coming out of TNG, DS9, and Voyager, it was just... disappointing. There's a lot that went wrong here, but I think the influence of 9/11 on American culture and television stands out. It took a 180 degree turn on portraying a future without prejudice (in fact most of the main characters are prejudiced in one form or another), and its theme song sucked. Yes, I'm going to lay at least some of the blame on the theme. Just listen to it, it's just bad.
 
So there you go, 757 episodes of Star Trek later, I hope you enjoyed the fruits of my ""labors"" over the past 9 months of quarantine. Instead of learning Mandarin, picking up the guitar, or reading more books, I watched all of Star trek, and with that burden of knowledge, I bestow up on you, 

My 2020 Definitive Ranking of Every* Star Trek Series** From Worst to Best!

*Excluding Star Trek: The Animated Series. Feel free to make a case for why I should have watched it below, but I have yet to hear one.
**Films and movies are a subject for another list. I think the procuction budgets, format, and timing constraints make films significantly different from content developed for a TV series. Also, they weren't on Netflix.
***It's important to know that a significant number of episodes were consumed in an almost podcast-like format while I went on solitary walks to get out of the house during quarantine.

In that time, nobody has said anything about it except my wife. Until yesterday.

I was walking through the bread aisle at the grocery store. A man about my age and his daughter (age 11, I would guess) were approaching opposite me. Suddenly, he grinned and said, ""Hey, check out this guy's mask!"" His daughter smiled and kind of gasped. I could tell they were both fans of the show.

Then he quizzed her: ""What's his rank?""

Since the first time I saw it it became my favorite piece of ST by a mile. One of the best elements of the long story arcs that DS9 develops (in contrast to the episodic nature of other ST shows) is how it can take a minor character and make him relevant.

Damar was Gul Dukat's right hand man when Dukat had been demoted and was serving as captain of a single ship. He was barely a named character. But he was there. 

When Dukat takes control of Cardassia allying with the Dominion Damar remains as his faithful ally and right hand man. He's marked by his loyalty to Dukat, the man that brought him up through the ranks. Damar is a proud cardassian and prone to drinking, but he does his duty to Dukat with great dilligence.

We see the first real development of this character when Dukat orders him to ""befriend"" his daughter, and we see how Damar is at a complete loss when dealing with civilians in any kind fashion. He's used to giving orders as a soldier, not being polite. He tries to convince her that her father is a great man, but she won't listen to him. Later when he finds out that Ziel betrayed the Cardassians he kills her, and struggles to get Dukat out of the station in vain. 

With Dukat gone Damar, this character that started out as almost irrelevant is now the puppet leader of the Cardassian Union. The weight of the murder, the lost of his mentor, and the responsabilities of guiding an entire country through a brutal struggle that is killing millions of Cardassians takes its tool on Damar. He starts to drink, and his continuous loss of power within the Dominion only exacerbates the situation. He's now a shadow of his former self. 

When the Dominion allies with the Breen Damar finally realizes that the Cardassians have lost favor completely, and that they are now themselves a subjugated people, much like they had once enslaved Bajor. Throughout the last arc of the series, Damar is a main character, betraying the Dominion and fighting for Cardassian Liberation.

The relationship between Dukat and Damar is also very interesting. He seems to have been the only truly genuine friend of Dukat, and both cared for each other, even when Dukat was already in full evil prophet mode. Damar probably saw Dukat as his mentor, and Dukat saw in Damar the respect that he so desperately craved from everyone else. 

TL:DR  - DS9 took a side character that was barely worth a name and (through 5 seasons) made him into a conflicted and loyal soldier thrust into power, devoured by depression that turned him to drinking before finally redeeming himself in a way.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270713,public,spoiler,I love how they developed the character of Damar in DS9,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/keeeut/i_love_how_they_developed_the_character_of_damar/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main reason my road to Star Trek was a bit odd was that it was 2013 and I was a 15 year-old Chinese girl. Not the target demographic of Star Trek nor the right time frame.
My brother was watching Star Trek (2009) on TV and tbh I thought it looked a bit rubbish. Rather than sitting through the film, I half listened and wikipedia-ed the synopsis. This led me down the Star Trek rabbit-hole... I was surprised how long it had been running for and how many incarnations there were. I then went on Youtube and found: the Picard Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6oUz1v17Uo). I loved it. I had no idea who the characters were but I kept listening. I eventually took the plunge and watched TNG what a great first episode! I was hooked. Hooked enough to get through the rather dubious season 1.

After that, I watched every incarnation, read loads of books, wrote a few terrible fanfictions, and chose to study Physics at university. Star Trek not only kindled my love of science, but also Shakespeare and humanity.

I did the same with my [TNG reviews](https://vengonofuoridallefottutepareti.com/2020/09/05/star-trek-the-next-generation-tng-reviews-of-a-selection-of-episodes/). This was 1990s TV and there's plenty to track!

1×12: Vortex  
Double The X-Files! The fugitive, Cliff De Young, was Doctor Nemman in the pilot episode, and the pursuing twins, Randy Oglesby, was the snake-handling reverend in Signs &amp; Wonders!  


1×14: The Storyteller  
One of the village officials, James Jansen, was Dr Werber in three episodes of The X-Files, thanks to whom Mulder remembered his sister’s abduction through regressive hypnosis.  


1×16: If Wishes Were Horses  
The dwarf is the dwarf actor of the 1990s-2000s: Michael J. Anderson, of Twin Peaks, The X-Files (Humbug) and Carnivále fame!  


1×17: The Forsaken  
One of the ambassadors, Michael Ensign, was Dr Barnes in the “ancient aliens” episodes of The X-Files, Biogenesis and The Sixth Extinction.  


1×19: Duet  
Yes, the impressive Harris Yulin was also on The X-Files, as Cardinal O’Fallon in the meta episode Hollywood A.D.!  


2×04: Invasive Procedures  
Wow, that Klingon was Megan Gallagher, who was Katherine Black, Frank’s wife, in Millennium!  


2×13: Armageddon Game  
One of the two ambassadors, Peter White, was the strict gate community manager in The X-Files‘ Arcadia and Sam Waters’ father in Profiler.  


2×15: Paradise  
The cult leader’s son was Michael B. Silver, who was an Area 51 Man In Black in The X-Files‘ two-part Dreamland!  


2×20: The Maquis, Part I / 2×21: The Maquis, Part II  
We have seen Admiral Nechayev several times in TNG already, but it is not until this episode that I realized that Natalija Nogulich was the one that had first been cast as Mulder’s informant “X” in The X-Files, before being recast by Steven Williams!  


2×22: The Wire  
The leader of the Obsidian Order (Enabran Tain), Paul Dooley, was the spooky incestuous father in the Millennium episode The Well-Worn Lock.  


2×25: Tribunal  
O’Brien’s soon-to-retire lawyer, Fritz Weaver, was in another trial in The X-Files as Senator Sorenson in the two-part Tunguska/Terma.  


3×11/3×12: Past Tense  
Bill Smitrovich (the simple family man turned civil rights activist Webb) was the memorable and sadly missed Detective Bletcher during season 1 of MillenniuM!  
Frank Military (the hot-tempered gang leader BC) was the “Son” in the unholy trinity of vampires in The X-Files‘ 3!  


3×24: Shakaar  
Among Kira’s ex-comrades there was William Lucking (who was Roky in perhaps The X-Files‘ best episode, José Chung’s From Outer Space, and a detective in Millennium).  


4×08: Little Green Men  
There’s a sort of genre TV reunion-before-the-fact here, with the scientist being Conor O’Farrell (will be in the main cast of Dark Skies as Lt. Albano just a year later) and the nurse being Meghan Gallagher (will be co-star Catherine Black in MillenniuM also just a year later)!  


4×18: Rules of Engagement  
T’Lara was Deborah Strang, who was the unfortunate genetically predisposed killer B.J. Morrow in The X-Files‘ Aubrey.  


4×24: The Quickening  
One of the patients is Dylan Haggerty, who will later be the trans-dimensional serial killer Lukesh in The X-Files‘ 4-D.  


5×06: Trials and Tribble-ations  
The agents of Temporal Investigations’ names, Lucsly and Dulmur, are anagrams of Scully and Mulder (!); and one of them, James W. Jansen, was Mulder’s hypnotist in The X-Files!  


5×08: Things Past  
Kurtwood Smith (Thrax) was the memorable Detective Patterson in The X-Files gargoyles episode, Grotesque!  


5×17: A Simple Investigation  
The beautiful guest, Dey Young, was unrecognizable in The X-Files‘ Born Again as the generic housewife whose dead husband is reincarnated in their daughter.  


5×25: In the Cards  
Among other roles, Brian Markinson, the crazy scientist here, was the guy who could see that his telemarketing job was turning everyone into zombies in the Folie à Deux episode of The X-Files!  


6×02: Rocks and Shoals  
The redshirt who, well, dies, was Joseph Fuqua, who played the (young version of) the inventor of time travelling in an episode of The X-Files, Synchrony!  


6×15: Honor Among Thieves  
The new boss Bilby was Nick Tate, who had a short but important role for the mythology of The X-Files, episode Two Fathers, as Dr. Openshaw.  


6×19: In the Pale Moonlight  
The Romulan Senator was Stephen McHattie, who was the Red-haired man, an unnamed executioner of the Syndicate, in the memorable two-parter of The X-Files, Nisei/731!  


7×08: The Siege of AR-558  
The rough soldier was Patrick Kilpatrick, who appeared in season 8 of The X-Files, Surekill. The desperate soldier was Raymond Cruz, who appeared in season 4 of The X-Files, El Mundo Gira, and as Tuco in Breaking Bad!  


7×18: Till Death Do Us Part

Overall, the Primary Deflector Assembly has a Different Construction than the Auxiliary Assembly. 

An MSD-esk Cutaway of the Intrepid class that I found labels three of the Functions of the Systems within the Auxiliary Deflector Assembly as ""Graviton Polarity Generation"", ""Field Distortion Amplifiers"", and ""Focusing Coils"" these descriptions moving from the aft most part of the assembly forward to right before what the Diagram labels as the ""Secondary Navigational Deflector Emitter Dish"".

I'm about to dive into Star Trek for the first time - all of Star Trek, right from the original series. Up until now, I've only ever seen odd scenes or the very occasional TNG episode that my parents might have had on in the background. The idea of Star Trek has always sounded super appealing to me though; I love me some sci-fi, world building, philosophy and ethics.  


I also run a YouTube channel, and wondered if there was an opportunity there to record something interesting from the perspective of someone who is diving into Star Trek for the first time. That's what I'm here to ask - as a Star Trek buff, someone who knows and loves the shows, what would you find interesting to hear from someone coming in with fresh eyes (if anything?)  


I could come at this from a few different angles. Something more akin to a straightforward review of each episode and what I thought of it; it could be something more directly philosophical where I discuss my thoughts or solutions on the presented dilemma (for applicable episodes, I realise that's not all of what Star Trek is); it could even be something a little gamified/puzzle solving, where I try to draw out a map of the ship/galaxy/historical timeline as accurately as possible (I have no idea how feasible that is). That's not an exhaustive list, and I come to the subreddit since someone who has seen Trek might be able to think of things I'd simply have no idea about.   


I guess I'll also finish with a broader question: if you could forget everything about Star Trek and go back and watch it all again like it was the very first time, is there anything *you'd* like to do with that opportunity?  


Thanks for your time folks, I'm sure I'll be counting myself amonst the Trekkies in no time!

Not a bald diplomatic starship captain who long passed his physical prime. 

From a screenwriting standpoint, it's the weakest part of the story in my opinion. However, from the inside perspective (inside Star Trek universe), it comes off like a setup to get rid of Picard by someone on the Federation side. Mostly, because of a scene at the beginning, when it was established that Picard didn't have much of a choice. This is kinda suspicious.

By the way, some people think that Riker was kinda an asshole in this episode, and yes he was to a degree, but I can understand why.

Each of these Holosuites is a Supercomputer that likely has a software and hardware more powerful than every piece of machinery in NASA combined. AND QUARK HAS 3 OF THOSE! 

What really gets me thinking is how the characters in these Holosuites are basically ALIVE! They are so perfectly simulated, with so much memory and programing going into each character, that they utterly believe they are real people? And I ask you, if you are indistinguishable from a real human, and truly believe you are a real human? **What is the difference?** They believe they feel emotion, so what's the difference between that and actually feeling it? Isn't the human brain just tricked by a series of impulses and substances much in the same manner? 

And then we get to more complicated characters, such as **The Doctor and Vic Fontaine.** THEY ARE SENTIENT! What the hell is the difference by that point? They are fully living organisms that feel emotions, have memories, and ponder their very existence. 

If Data can be regarded as an individual, than so should they. If anything, a sentient character of a Holosuite is far more of an individual than Data, as they are capable of experiencing things Data cannot, such as emotion.

It's become and ineffectual bureaucracy.  It makes it difficult for the crew of a starship to actually make a difference.  The prime directive is one rule that annoys me.  There should be exceptions to the prime directive to be able to interfere to prevent planetary disasters, etc.  Interfering for personal gain or for the benifit of the federation should be prohibited.  Then you have the temporal accord.  The rules against time travel.  Usually not using time travel is a good idea.  But there are exceptions to every rule.  The temporal accord didn't exist in star trek four but if it had and kirk had followed it earth would have been wiped out.  

So interference should be judged on a case by case basis as to whether or not it's justified.  Having rules that say you can't do something no matter the situation is just not practical.  That is one thing I like about the original series.  And I don't like the original series.  But they weren't bogged down in rules and regulations as much.  So they were able to get more done.

The extra vertical ridge that now sits on the Talosians' heads. The new makeup they use for the Orions. Phasers shooting out bolts instead of beams. Pike's wheelchair being pretty much completely different. Even stuff like the interfaces they use. In Mandalorian, everything just looks right. The locations and sets look authentic to the established canon. The visual design for every single alien species is consistent with how they looked, or if they're new, how they would have looked. Even the various interfaces on consoles and ships didn't get an update to make them more ""appropriate"" for the quality of television today. They deliberately chose to stay consistent to what's been established. Those crappy vector graphics do way more for me than all the hologram stuff on Discovery. I know it's not exactly a 1:1 situation. Obviously the 1966 standards for a TV show were very different than for a 1977 motion picture.

But this song is just... it's bad outside of the context of the show and the series.  Combine it with everything else and I have to ask... Like, was someone BFFs with someone who owned the rights and wanted to get them a fat paycheck or something?  Or did someone just sincerely think it was a good idea?

Since we know what effects Trellium D had on T’Pol, couldn’t we infer that this could have had something to do with her initial attraction to Trip?

I think it's very cool how they can simultaneously not show any discrimination towards Stamets and Culber ( or Reno) for being gay or Adira for being nonbinary, but also depict a queer found family among the four or them that feels familiar and real (at least to me as someone who has been peripheral to a lot of those families). 

It's also just really great for Stamet's growth as a character. Tilly was looking up to him as a mentor in the first two seasons and while they had their moments she ended up finding better mentors in Michael and Saru. Paul was just too cold and wasn't able to really warm to her when she needed him to. But Adira is an actual teenager and that's clearly got Stamets way outside his comfort zone, which is when Anthony Rapp really shines as an actor. I don't know if the Instagram posts are canon, but the idea in this one [https://www.instagram.com/p/CIgXz1TonO1/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIgXz1TonO1/) that Stamets is trying to be a better ""dad"" to Adira than his dad was to him just really hits home with me.

I hope they do more with this relationship, and with Adira dealing with all the memories of the Tal symbiont and especially Grey's memories, before the season is over.

I'm interested for ideas and differing opinions.

TOS:

Overrated: The Carbomite maneuver.

I don't get the appeal. It was much too slow and boring.

Underrated: The Squire of Gothos

(It's so great; a predecessor of Q and I like the twist at the end. Maybe this ep is well liked, but I didn't find it in any best-of lists)

(I've only seen the first 20 episodes and the pilot of TOS)

&amp;#x200B;

TNG

Overrated: 

Data's Day: (it doesn't bring anything new to Data's character and I don't like how it portrays Keiko)

Who watches the watchers: I really don't think Picard arguments why it's wrong to interfere hold up AT ALL. There are people (Troi and Riker) at risk and he already has (even involuntaryly) greatly influenced these people; they're thinking of him as a god. 

Picard clinging to a Dogma instead of thinking something through case for case is the reason why he's rated so low on my best captain list 

Any Q episode (this includes Tapestry): Q is maybe my least favourite character in the whole Trek verse

Underrated: 

The High Ground

Premptive Strike

In both episodes the conflicts aren't portrayed as black and white, something that is unfortunately often the case with TNG

Rightful heir: This episode is really neat

&amp;#x200B;

DS9:

Overrated: this is hard, because all episodes that are generally hold in greatest esteem are all really that good, so I'll nominate all mirror universe episodes, because I just really hate the mirror universe concept

Underrated: ..Nor the Battle to the strong

I don't think it isn't well-liked, but I think it deserves to be under the top 10 ds9 episodes. Dealing with similiar themes, it left a bigger impact on me than ""The siege of AR-588""

&amp;#x200B;

VOY:

Overrated: Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy

I'm baffled that this epsiode is on so many TOP episodes list. I think it isn't really fun and it isn't endearing. The doctor dreaming that every female main cast member is into him gets old veeery fast. Don't get me wrong, you can make this joke once, maybe twice, but there are multiple scenes with it, so it feels excessive. It's an episode that I feel like skipping. I just can't stand it. I prefer Fair haven and maybe even Spirit Folk to it and I loooathe these episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

Underrated: 

\-Prototype, I don't know if my nostalgia is blinding me, (Prototype was one of the first episodes of Star Trek that I watched) but this episode holds up every time I watch it. It is one of the best engineer-centric episodes in the whole of Star Trek.

But I generally loove B'elanna-centric episodes, she's my favourite character and she isn't well liked in the fandom

But seriously guys; Prototype, Dreadnought, Revulsion and Juggernaut are just great episodes.

I also really like The thaw(the one with fear personified as a clown played by MIchael McKean. But I don't think The thaw is a underrated episode, it's a polarizing episodes, people hate it or love it.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't watched enogh Enterprise to comment.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't watched TAS and Lower Decks (I live in Europe and I don't pirate....yet) and I didn't finish Picard because I didn't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can't rate singular Disco episodes, because all of them build more or less one season arc. This gets better in Season 3 though, I feel there the episodes stand more on each own, even if only weakly.

i also don't know which episodes of Discovery are liked by the fanbase.

People seem to like Magic to make the sanest man go mad, I like it too but I prefer Lethe over it.

I think season 3 of Discovery is overrated. It is the best season, but it is only slightly better than the others. It has still too many flaws, that it didn't grow out of enough in my opinion.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270625,public,self,episodes that are most overrated and underrated in your opinion,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kdlu2z/episodes_that_are_most_overrated_and_underrated/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite my problem with their logic, I love the Vulcan species, and I wanted to make some changes on their design, like making their ears bigger and able to move to convey 'emotions' once they are typically stoic (like minimoys ears). Another problem I have with Star Trek's alien culture, is how 'unified' it is, I haven't watched everything Star Trek has to offer yet, but as for this moment, I think that the aliens lack the diversity we have on Earth, for example, in Vulcan, you have the Surak's followers and the folks who are against Surak's teachings.... is there any Vulcan nation that has nothing to do with Surak at all? I miss the 'nations' element from the aliens.
And this is just the iceberg's tip.

But it's kind of the opposite. I feel like they are crapping all over LBGTQ+ rights with them, especially Adira. 

First why do they have to put the two LBGTQ+ people together? This doesn't bother me a lot, but it does feel very contrived and silly. Stamet's experience as a gay man in the 23rd century has nothing to do with a non-binary character in the 32nd century. Ok in universe it's kind of because of Adira's fascination with the spore drive, but then why do they never seem to do anything except talk about their emotions and confusion. Goodness me, get some freaking Star Trek in there with the Melo-drama please. 

Secondly Why did he volunteer her as able to write the algorithm. If he KNOWs she can and is trying to get her to step up why doesn't he tell her to say this? It felt like that whole scene was just a set up for the later They/Them pronouns discussion. On that not why was Adira scared to tell anyone about it before Stamets? Do you mean to tell me that in 1,200 years we haven't made enough progress on the trans acceptance movement on Earth that it's even more taboo than now? What ever happened to the argument they have made in the past about doing this. In the future people don't care that Picard is bald or about interracial kisses. This is doing the EXACT opposite of that. I get that it's supposed to kind of be a dystopian future rather than the Utopia of the 23rd and 24th centuries, but if this is the case you need to at least hint at some reason why we might have slid backwards, maybe some new religious movement or an under-population crisis after the burn. But this is a dying society, not a reborn society. Also she ALWAYS felt this way but didn't feel OK telling ANYONE? Really? Not even their Trans Boyfriend?

Then to get away from the woke aspect of it entirely, right after this conversation they are suddenly in a music room together. Stamet's is on the Piano Adira on Cello, then after she plays he says ""I didn't know you played Cello"". Then WHY DID YOU GUYS GO TO THE MUSIC ROOM TOGETHER? You didn't question this when she got up and walked to the music room and you sat on the piano to accompany her? Really? Not when she picked up the Cello, rosined up her bow and got ready to play?

Look Star Trek has and hopefully always will be a perfect medium to push progressive ideas. It's the future where our petty issues of today are presumably resolved. But this is just such a 180 on how the have successfully handled these issues before. It feels like they are trying to create a bigger issue rather than try to address them here. It feels like they have gotten extremely lazy with Stamets character, especially contrasted to Cubler who has become an important character who happens to be gay instead of a character who is basically only important because he is Gay and a few other things from the first episode.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270568,public,spoiler,[RANT] Frustrations with DSC regarding Adira and Stamets.

I have never seen a single episode of Star Trek in my life (not even any of the films) and have been thinking that it might be fun to start watching the show. However I'm finding where to start with the show pretty intimidating. I don't want to watch hundreds of episodes (I don't have all the time in the world), so am just looking for the best point to jump onto the show.

I think I want to start with Star Trek: The Next Generation, as I like Patrick Stewart and am concerned that the original series might just be a bit too dated for me. But should I just start with Series 1 episode 1 of TNG? Or is it one of those shows which only really goods good after a couple of seasons? Do I need to watch all the episodes in order, or could I just google ""Best Star Trek TNG episodes"" and watch those?

Seeing the somewhat polarized reaction to Discovery has been a strange experience. I've come out of every season of the show impressed. And I think there are a few Discovery episodes that rival even the best episodes of TNG. That being The Sound of Thunder and Unification III.

Is it as good as TNG? Absolutely not. It was never going to be. As unfortunate as it might be for us. I don't believe that a 90s era style of Trek show could ever work in the modern entertainment climate. I've always seen Discovery as an attempt to create a show which was capable of becoming popular today while also being true to the series' origins. I can only imagine how difficult this must be to do. When you do something like that, you're always going to piss people off. Everyone has their own version of what Star Trek is ""about"" or what it means, so its kind of impossible to please even the majority of the community. And even on a more objective level, this kind of transition will always leave some unfortunate artifacts in the show; I see the admittedly very messy tangle of plot lines that plague the first two seasons of evidence of that.

I also find the reaction to several of the series' more political choices to be somewhat... perplexing. I know its been said before, but Star Trek is and always has been a progressive franchise. First interracial kiss, first same-sex kiss. Why anyone was upset about Star Trek continuing to be that way with the gay couple and now the non-binary character is beyond me, and makes me question why they're watching the series in the first place. The stock response I hear to that is ""oh well they didn't push it in our faces back then."" Honestly, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't really see much of a difference between the way that previous series handled their more progressive areas. 

They barely even acknowledge that there's a same sex couple in the show. There wasn't some big reveal there, there just was a gay couple and that was that. The non-binary scene was literally: ""I feel like more of a they then a she"" ""oh okay I'll call you they then"". Contrast that to the anti-capitalist speech that Picard goes on during First Contact. If a single scene of someone asking for their pronouns to be respected is pushing it in our faces, but Picard literally going on a speech about how much better the future is because we got rid of capitalism is not. Then I just don't understand what the problem is. 

In conclusion... fandoms confuse me. I often find the very critical and emotional nature of reactions to recent entries in many franchises to be annoying, and pretty unwarranted. It really just seems like certain people are trying to find things to be angry about. That doesn't mean there isn't room for constructive criticism, but this kind of criticism seems pretty emotional and baseless. Although I do have a tendency to find things to enjoy in most of the entertainment I consume, so maybe I'm just particularly optimistic and minimizing flaws in my head.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270556,public,self,Some thoughts on modern Trek.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kd4m0d/some_thoughts_on_modern_trek/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1: They are not fleshing out the bridge crew at all. I don't really know any names or arcs with the exception of Detmer and frankly not enough of her. I would prefer some episodes based around these characters to open up the show and kinda drop the Michael/Burn centred story for a bit so I can get to know the rest of the crew.

2: Where are all the lead men? I support inclusion and representation of strong women, different races and species, LGTB and gender fluidity but season 3 seems lob sided and I personally don't feel drawn to any male member and I miss that. Book seems jammed in only for Michael's sake, Saru is still very soft for a captain (and not human), the Admiral is just a dick so the only 2 left are Colber and Stamets but they don't get enough screen time either.

I wonder if I'm being a snowflake here but I would like to see a more balanced show and have another Pike or Lorca type emerge as I think they are really being missed this season.

I also knew a lot of people had negative opinions of the show early on so I was wary.

In the first few episodes I was intrigued but I didn’t really like any of the characters save for maybe Captain Georgiou (note I’m gonna refer to prime Georgiou as captain Georgiou and mirror as emperor Georgiou).  I think the emperor did give a good critique of Burnham in one of the later episodes “you don’t follow through”.  I found Michael unbearable in the first few episodes.  They were headstrong, know-it-all, but then mopey and hateful.  They were almost the worst combination of human and Vulcan you could think of.  Intelligent and logical but their emotions took over enough to SHOOT THEIR FUCKING CAPTAIN?!  And then their emotions took over enough to be depressed about and push everyone around them away.  Seemingly it was intended from the beginning that Michael would open up more to their crew mates, and their own humanity and learn what it means to be human.  So over time I grew to like Michael.

A writing problem I had with some of the characters was that they pivoted too quickly.  Besides the security officer that they offer early on.  Like Lorca was every bit a Terran Imperial officer at first but he softens rather quickly and seemingly with no real rhyme or reason, then once in the mirror universe he immediately pivots back to mustache twirlingly evil.  This frustrates me bacause I had started to like Lorca.  I thought when he mentioned that he had attempted a coup against the emperor that he meant like he was trying to make positive changes in the empire.  NOPE!  He’s even more of a xenophobe than the emperor who genocided the Klingons and ate Kelpian for dinner?!  He was a misogynist and groomed mirror Burnham into a sexual relationship to get to the emperor?!  Dude’s just a creep.  There is a small part of me that hopes to see prime Lorca at some point and that the admiral is wrong about his inability to survive the mirror universe.

  Saru is seems to have gone from a minor role to a much more pivotal one fairly quickly.  His initial mistrust of burnham seems to be only partially founded, then it’s like he suddenly is cool with her again like a light switch.  As the season progresses I grow to really like Saru though, to the point that he’s probably my favorite character.

I’m not going to say too much else but I liked Ash Tyler’s and Michael Burnham’s relationship.  I thought they wrapped it up pretty well with their last scene together before landing on the Klingon home world.  Though I feel like it must have been devistating to Michael for Tyler to go with L’rell.

Thoughts?

my other idea is to do kind of a Star Trek JAG type thing but the gag there is they never actually win a case because every crazy explanation is actually true.

The orange sauce next to it makes it almost seem like Cholula Hot Sauce except that the traditional wooden knob top is missing (it seems to have the same hearty thickness as Cholula at any rate, but it could also be a hot butter-based wing sauce).


.


There is a taller third bottle though with a green top on one of the bottles.  Now it could be Tabasco Green, but I think that's a wrong guess.  The bottles are standardized on all of the tables, so why would anyone always buy the original size of one Tabasco but the larger size of the other?  If we factor out Tabasco green, then what hot sauce could it be?    


Please keep in mind that a restaurant would probably buy hot sauces by the case, so a boutique (rare) hot sauce that you might find in a hot sauce store just isn't likely.  In terms of balance given the other two heats /flavors /consistencies, it could be a sriracha sauce... but I just don't recognize the brand.  Also, given how Sisko Sr loves to cook with items from earth, let's factor out an off-world 24th century brand. 


I'm including a screen shot of the table and it shouldn't be any kind of spoiler.   All opinions are welcome please!

I don't want to call the actors wooden, but they're definitely very proper. They speak very clearly, their accents impeccable and there's pretty much no slang as far as I've gotten. And the ship is just incredibly clean, the sets are very well put together but they don't really feel lived in. There's no wear and tear anywhere.

Live long and watch a lot of Star Trek! I have just spent the last 2 years developing the ultimate spreadsheet for Trekkies. I built it out of love for everything Star Trek and can't live without it. Basically it is an Excel Spreadsheet that tracks everything Star Trek.

**The Website Link attached is to my spreadsheet compiled in XLSPadlock, that I have been building for the last few years that acts as a detailed personal database of everything we have ever watched in the entire Star Trek Franchise.** 

The database is currently up to date and includes Lower Decks, Picard Series 1 and provision for Series 2 and Discovery 1-3 with already provision for season 4 because it has been announced. And ALL the short treks are included as well as all the episodes of After Trek for Discovery Series 1 and The Ready Room with Will Wheaton for Picard, Discovery Series 3 and the beginning, middle and end of the first series of Lower Decks.

All of the titles in the database are all hyper linked to memory alpha as well so you can check up on the details before or after you record the details about the show you just watched. Including if it is a favourite, how many times you watched it and any notes or comments you want to make.

And I have created something called MY TREKS. This is a shareable database built into the application. So as a fan finds something new and interesting for Star Trek they just add it to the database and on a monthly basis I intend to push out an update with everyone's contributions. The beauty of this spreadsheet is that updated compiles easily restore your existing personal database which is automatically saved and stored separately every time you close the application.

It is a really great book and what would be more awesome than this is an audio version of the boom read by none other than Andrew Robinson himself.

At the moment it is not an official thing, but there is a petition going to try and get 5,000 signatures and it could happen. We are getting close with around 4,100 or so signatures so it would be much appreciated if you could take a minute to sign the petition.

I quite liked the episode and given how long these episodes are.. and the setting, it felt more like an old movie.

Kirk's dilemma was fun to watch unfold, Spock had a lot of great lines, and the whole plot of the episode was well put together, but I found the machine Spock built just showing them exactly what they needed to see a bit convenient..  although I admit I might have missed something in the dialogue.

The ending was great, with Kirk not even responding to the Guardian and after a brief pause just saying: ""Let's get the hell out of here"", and then they just leave.   Oh yeah, and Edith Keeler was a hottie, I would have had a big dilemma on my hands in Kirk's situation too

I respect that completely. I didn’t and want to vent. 

I just finished it and I don’t think an episode has irritated me this much in a while. This has to be one of the stupidest Trek episodes ever- everyone just has the idiot ball throughout (except Seven, Tuvok, and Torres). Janeway really put the life of her digital boyfriend over the lives of the Doctor, Kim, and Paris instead of shutting down the damn program! And then the episode has the audacity to make that BS sympathetic? 

Can we talk about the unfortunate implications in this and the first Fair Haven ep? Janeway got rid of Micheal’s digital wife, destroyed all memory of her, AND fully reprogrammed him because she viewed him as fictional and not real (like most holodeck characters). Then in this ep she’s treating him and the other FH characters as more important than her crew despite them being able to be fixed (like Paris did between episodes). Also the fact any holodeck character can be taken out of the program via the holo emitter (which really should only work for the Doctor) and given sentience through a malfunction (at least in TNG when Moriarity became sentient there was a better described reason). 

The entire thing not only seems stupid, but is really uncomfortable the more you think about it (especially in the light of what other flesh characters have done to holodeck characters in this franchise- you’re telling me they were ALL capable of sentience with the right computer problems?). I mean even just between these two VOY eps it’s frightening because Janeway killed the dude’s wife and wiped everyone’s memories- wasn’t she sentient too then?

All that aside, how do you think they could pull it off storywise?

My approach would be to essentially make the Tkon Empire = the Galactic Empire.

Like Star Trek IV for example.  After they time travel back from earth with humpback whales, they created a new timeline where earth survives the probe and humpback whales are no longer extinct.

Star Trek First Contact creates a universe where the Borg took the place of Vulcans at First Contact and had assimilated Earth.

Nothing like a pandemic and some serious paternity leave to get through it all. They are all great. TBH TNG was probably the weakest (strongest characters though) but I am not writing this to list my preferences. My biggest problems with each series though are:

TNG: Lack of over arching story arch

DS9: The religious subplot didn't interest me

Voyager: The first season or two should have definitely dealt with the conflict between the two crews.

One thing i have noticed since watching Discovery is the difference in pace and loudness. The starships/stations of TNG, DS9 and Voyager are so quiet and peaceful. The glimpses of space out the window were, at first, quite claustrophobic but the darkness and the humming of the spaceship fills me with such a sense of tranquility.

It's mediocre television at best and absolutely terrible as Star Trek.

For example there was a scene where Picard was repulsed by the former borg on the artifact because of his assimilation PTSD. But after seeing how Hugh was helping them reclaim their lives it helped him work through some things and see the former borg as victims like him instead of monsters. Overcoming prejudice in space is a classic pillar of Star Trek and I was glad to see this in here. Unfortunately, it was a 20 second throwaway scene and the former borg are never shows as anything but mindless zombies for the rest of the season. That scene could have been expanded to an entire episode of TNG and it probably would have been one of the best if it were.

Then we have 7 of 9 grappling with the idea of taking over all the drones on the artifact to fight the Romulans and ultimately save all their lives. Ends vs. means in space, another pillar of good star trek. But again this idea is explored for about 10 seconds and then discarded and never really returned to. It's a convenient bit of deus ex machina disguised as a theme.

There were a lot of little scenes too which bothered me in a Star Trek context. It just did not depict a future I could be hopeful for and that's probably the most important characteristic of Star Trek

And for my last example of why it's bad star trek, there is the part where one of the androids does a mind meld with Agnes to try and clarify what her vision meant. Maybe they were wrong about the message? Maybe the advanced synthetics are peaceful and it was the fear of the unknown that caused the Romulans to think they are destroyers. Nope. Same message, just stated more clearly this time. This could have been the most star trek part of the series if it was done differently.

And even if it was the same story in a different, not star trek, show it still wasn't great. The main plot was a bad Mass Effect rip off and the ship was extremely boring (I don't even remember its name and I finished the show last night!). I liked some of the characters (Rios and his holograms for example)  but others were pretty bad. The guy with the sword for example. You could remove all his lines and replace him with a dog and it would not change a thing about the rest of the show. Another bit of deus ex machina disguised as a character this time. Hugh was well done but under used. There could have been some really interesting plotlines about him exploring what it means to survive being assimilated.

First up and out the gate I'm a TNG guy. The pilot episode of TNG is the first memory I have of watching TV with my Dad. I was hooked. Movies, TOS, DS9, VOY and ENT. I've watched em all time and again. I've bought models. Learned some Klingon. I'm a Trekkie

The Kelvin movies for me are like some kinda grotesque sideshow. It's almost as if the events depicted are being remade as a holonovel and we're watching the result. Too flashy, too gaudy, and none of it makes sense. It exists and it's a giant cartoon but it's not for me.

Imagine my excitement at learning a contemporary big budget Star Trek series was in the works. Man I couldn't wait. I had this feeling that Trek could rival the MCU or Game of Thrones in terms of marketability and outright mania. The diversity of stories and adventures available within the Trek universe is STAGGERING. Then I heard Bryan Fuller was on board. Wow. An actual genuine TV talent. Someone who understands budget, visual and story telling appeal.... Nicolas Myer?! Holy shit. Then word of an anthology series.... Different crew, different setting each season! Yeeesssssss! Hook it to my veins!


Then Fuller left. Then Alex Kurtzman came aboard.... Ok ok.... It could still be good, right? Then, news that the anthology idea had been jettisoned, this would be a prequel. Oh no. Oh lord no. I had zero faith in Kurtzman respecting canon. I was right. 

I watch Discovery. I will continue to watch Discovery. But I'm not a fan. I watch because it's Trek. But in so many ways it let's itself down. And I'm getting tired of coming onto Trek forums and looking to engage in a reasonable discussion about Discovery without it's defenders acting like spoiled children or explaining plot holes using their own head canon. 

We're fans. We've invested hundreds of hours in this franchise, it's universe and it's characters. We're allowed be miffed when somone produces a serious that is totally disrespectful of that franchise. 

I know people harp on about this - but yes, Michael's crying. It's absolutely ridiculous. For comparison; imagine LaForge shedding a tear when dressed down by Picard. Or Bones. Or Odo weeping because Sisko said he didn't trust him. Remember DS9? Remember how all the characters felt like they cared and loved one another without saying it in every episode? Or hugging? Starfleet is a para-military organisation. These people are soldiers and explorers. They know how to comport themselves in front of their superiors. 

Her continued insubordination and her crew's tolerance of same is ludicrous. 
The mycilical network is farcical. Roller-coaster turbo lifts. The set design of Discovery is lazy as fuck man. Glowing corridors. Awesome. The Mirror Universe is a cheap, played out concept. Enough. Give us something new man!!! We're in the 31st century now man!!! New races... New empires... New Tech.... Give me new ideas, new worlds, new species, new sci-fiction spins, show me a Q joining Star Fleet, let's see what lies outside the Milky Way... Let's deal with Black Holes... Strange new phenomena.... I don't wanna see fucking Tilly with a new hair do acting evulz. 

I could go on and on ranting about my feelings on Discovery. But largely I feel disappointed. Let down.... They had a PERFECT opportunity here to move forward, a post Nemisis and post Kelvin incursion timeline. 25th century. New ship. New crew. And they wasted it. So now we have Picard instead.... 
Best not get me started there! 

Look - in short; I love Trek. Even when I hate it. I'm glad there's Trek on TV. But Discovery is SUCH a wasted opportunity..... It could have been so amazing. But instead I guess I'll tune it to hear about how Micheal Burnham is the only person capable of saving the Universe for the 33rd time in a row, then watch her cry for a bit.

Some years ago, I realized that Star Trek is sci-fi as a convenient fall-back idea for a series, but it was really a show about a group of people who are faced with unusually difficult, never-before-seen ethical dilemmas, and how  the group and each individual is able to go against their animalistic instincts and choose a better course of action with individual moral restraint.  I like this a lot about Star Trek.  


A person or society as a whole can stereotype a lot of things about Trekkies...but, on the whole, I don't think ""bad"", ""dangerous"", or ""evil"", nor any similar such negative adjective, could ever really be believed by anyone.  Nobody is scared of Star Trek fans.  They're usually pretty ok or even really good people - even if they aren't rich or powerful enough to actually be considered ""eccentric"" and are just considered ""weird"".  I like that about Star Trek a lot again.  


Enterprise never held my attention, though I honestly haven't ever tried hard yet.  Discovery, Idk... I heard it basically ruins canon and has some issues and has this alternate timeline thing...I'm not sure the details, but it ""breaks the rules"", I hear....  And I *did* see the JJ Abrams movie - the first of the three.  It wasn't a bad movie... I liked it like I liked the Star Wars one.... it was indeed in a ""Star Trek""-ish-in-appearance setting, but I didn't like it because it didn't feel like Star Trek and seemed more concerned with dramatic action and adventure than holding the crew and captain to high moral standards through extremely challenging trials and ethical decisions and dilemmas....   


And then I just started Picard.  I like Picard. I didn't realize it was a real Star Trek, as someone else described it to me as more of a sitcom in the Star Trek universe.  In my opinion, though, it's the first legitimate SEQUEL series to the TNG, DS9, VOY era series... and is official.. and very good.  **I thought it was ironic that the first episode was about Picard getting questioned why he left Starfleet, and he discusses later the moral issue of the Federation/Starfleet turning on their promises to protect Romulans - which leads to a massacre of Romulans - which leads him to reply, ""I left because IT WAS NO LONGER STARFLEET!""**  


I feel like he is, at this point in space-time, making a cool one-off series that fades away, **OR**, he is the beginning of the community of Trekkies and Star Trek people as a whole who decide to forbid this new Hollywood-esque, hollow Star Trek stuff, and bring Star Trek series' and films back to what they do best and the way they are naturally supposed to be.....   


Should the DS9 guys do a Star Trek: Sisko to complement, along side?  They could even make both of them interact, but specifically exclude the new amoral actiony Star Trek malignant ideas, which we really ought to reclassify as ""fan fiction"" someday, but I degress.

From what I have gathered, Shatner's sin is supporting the wrong Austism charity, because they want to cure a condition that most Level 1 Autistics do not see as a disease. I get that. I support neurodiversity in every form. But why do we condescend to that selfish attitude? There are two other levels of Autism, and those tend to be the marriage-wreckers, the bankruptcies, and the lifetime of suffering.   


I have two mothers in my family/professional life with Level 3 Autistic sons. If you have never lived with a person in this condition, it's a lifetime of diapers, home supervision, and often outbursts of madness and violence. My client came to a meeting with stitches on her face from her L3A adult son throwing furniture when he couldn't find his blanket. There are many people living with Autism and people in the Autism community who do not have the freedom of a Level 1 patient--the kind of a person with a job and plenty fo time to talk about Star Trek. Shatner's cardinal sin seems to be that, even as a 90ish year old man, he still works to raise money for families like these.  


Moreover, Shatner is not a Nazi, a fascist, a racist, or even a Republican. He's a liberal Canadian Jew and an old man who doesn't want to be bullied with the latest fashion progressive language. If you ask Mark A. Altman, author of THE FIFTY YEAR MISSION, he'll share with you detailed stories of his generosity, charity, and 100% non-bigoted non-Nazi political skepticism. In short, WS is a skeptical old man - not an activist.  


Can someone further unpack the Autism angle? Are there missing facts? The call for mob violence this morning was my breaking point. I could care less about being booted from a group with 40 comments calling Shatner a Nazi, but it's reached the point where Star Trek fans need to stop condescending to the large community of L31s in Trek. Seriously, calling for a mob to take off his head?!",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270082,public,self,"The campaign by Autistic Trek fans against William Shatner is out of control, largely because fans condescend to the Autistic mob.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kai3zg/the_campaign_by_autistic_trek_fans_against/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

___

**Episode 38 - ""Terra Firma, Part 1""**

* Kovich's inside-out holographic reconstruction of Georgiou may be the same technology developed by the EMH in ""Latent Image.""
* The hologram of Yor is wearing a Starfleet uniform most closely associated with TNG's first two seasons, placing it between the 2350s and mid 2360s. Yor is described as a lieutenant commander but his uniform collar is missing a rank.
* Yor is of the same species as Traitt in ""That Hope is You."" Initially identified as a Yridian, it was noted in The Ready Room that the species is intended to be Betelgeusian, though this has not been established in canon.
* Kovich explains that temporal travel can ""make you pretty sick."" In ""Relativity"" it was established that repeated time jumps could result in temporal psychosis.
* It is also explained that ""molecules"" don't like jumping around between time or dimension. In ""Parallels"" Worf's timeline-jumping was confirmed by examining his quantum signature.
* Yor's origins are described as an alternate universe created by ""the temporal incursion of a Romulan mining ship."" This is a reference to the establishment of what we refer to as the Kelvin Timeline, the setting of the most recent ""Abrams trilogy"" beginning with *Star Trek 2009.* The mining ship belonged to Nero, who went back in time after seeing the destruction of Romulus in 2379. This is the first on-screen acknowledgement of the Kelvin Timeline within the Prime Timeline, and its description as an ""alternate universe"" perhaps establishes it is somewhat different than a typical alternate *timeline* created by normal time-travel shenanigans.
* Kovich claims Yor was heretofore the only person known to have jumped across both time and dimension; this also describes Nero, his crew, and Spock, as they jumped from PT 2379 to KT 2233/2258. It seems Kovich knows the Kelvin Timeline exists but nothing more than that.
* Yor died because the Temporal Accords prevented the Federation from sending him home. This rigidity to rules and regulations at the cost of an individual's life doesn't sound anything at all like the Federation we know and love, but does sound exactly like the Federation that allowed Thad Riker to needlessly die, as related in ""Nepenthe.""
* Culber calls up a medical analysis which displays in front of him. The text is otherwise unremarkable, but refers to Georgiou's condition using the phrase ""universal constant,"" which evokes the time travel rules not of Star Trek but of Lost.
* Dannus V is a new location, but it is close to the Gamma Quadrant; I believe this is the first mention of that region in the series.
* Worf's calisthenics program may be a descendant of the *Discovery's* gymnasium, which appears to include, um, bladed weapons.
* Burnham gives Georgiou a Fitbit, a technology introduced in ""Consumer Electronics Expo 2013.""
* Hiraga Gennai was an Edo-era scientist known for...*looks him up*...the essay ""On Farting.""
* Carl reads the latest edition of *The Star Dispatch.* The newspaper (which used to be a common fictional paper throughout Hollywood) was previously seen in the projected alternate timeline where Edith Keeler survived in ""The City on the Edge of Forever.""
* On the back of the paper is a review of the soup at the Twenty-First Street Mission, which was the kitchen run by Edith Keeler. The accompanying picture is a stock photo of a real-life Depression bread line and I don't think it maps to Trek.
* Below the review is a stylized quote: ""Let Me Help!"" Keeler offered this sentiment to James Kirk, who countered that in the future those words would be cherished even above ""I love you.""
* Given all these extremely subtle freeze-frame references, it is worth observing that ""Edge of Forever"" involved the crew finding a deserted planet hosting a portal, with a Guardian, that allowed you to step back in time.
* A smaller headline on the front page of the paper reads ""Supernova Threatens Tkon Empire."" The Tkon Empire was featured in ""The Last Outpost"" and were an advanced society living 600,000 years ago until a supernova destroyed their homeworld. The only identified remnant of the Tkon was in the form of an outpost guardian called The Portal, asleep on a deserted planet. On a completely unrelated note, Spock estimated the Guardian of Forever to be approximately one million years old.
* Another reads ""Starship USS Jenolan Reported to Be Missing."" The *Jenolan* was en route to Norpin Colony in 2294 when it crashed into a Dyson sphere. There were 1.467 survivors.
* The back page of the paper also features some ancient Vulcan script, accompanied by a simplified IDIC symbol, crudely-drawn as though it were a rune.
* There is a crossword puzzle on the back page, but it is composed of hexagons, not squares. I don't know what this could indicate, and the pattern of the grid isn't familiar.
* The price of the paper is 15 quatloos, the initial wager that Kirk was untrainable in ""The Gamesters of Triskelion.""
* Besides all that, Georgiou's apparent time-travel journey is also reminiscent of the Orb of Time in ""Wrongs Darker than Death or Night.""
* Epsilon Indi, in the Prime universe, was an area of dispute for the Triacus Marauders in ""And the Children Shall Lead.""
* Kepler-174d is the name of a potentially habitable exoplanet discovered in 2014. I believe this may be the first mention of a real-life exoplanet, although there are several stars featured in Trek that have been found to host exoplanets after the fact.
* Mirror Stamets refers to Georgiou as ""Daughter of Rome,"" explicit evidence that the Terran Empire may be a direct successor to what we think of as long-dead power.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,270070,public,spoiler,"Canon References - ""Terra Firma, Part 1"" [Spoilers]",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/kaezgp/canon_references_terra_firma_part_1_spoilers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The computer sends them to this specific far-away planet to cure Georgiou, where they can't easily communicate with Starfleet. The info about the distress signal is only revealed when they are away from Starfleet.

The computer creates a Kelpian starfleet captain to impress Saru.

The Kelpian woman is dressed in white, just like the Zora hologram in Calypso.

All in all, the Sphere data AI has unfinished business in that nebula which has nothing to do with the Burn.

I made it into Season 7 yesterday and am watching the episode Imperfections. So, Seven asked B'Elanna if she believes in an after life and B'Elanna responds, ""I hope so""!?!?!? Wasn't there a waste of time episode where you experienced a near death event and went aboard the Klingon Death Ship of Dishonor to save your mother? And you say you hope so! Out of everyone on Voyager you should know best B'Elanna Torres! Good thing Seven didn't ask Neelix, with the whole Big Tree in the afterlife episode. We weren't given a clear explanation to that. Does he believe in an afterlife or is he all smiles on the outside, but a cold lifeless hulk on the inside?

Also, I have noticed this previously, but haven't mentioned this on Reddit yet. Who is keeping the pacing for the show? They go from time critical to we need 5 minutes of dialog, when they should've been blown away by then. Captain the shields are at 52%, Bam, 26%, Bam, Captain shields are down, Bam, all of crewman Schlekis belongings are lost in space again Captain and we can't take another hit. Beam me over Captain, it's the only way you will make it through. Are you sure xxxxxxx, we were just getting to know you and what will we do without your cooking? I am sure Captain and as far as the cooking goes, you have Neelix and the Replicators (Rim Shot). Okay, we will beam you over. Captain should I notify such-and-such that xxxxxxx is going to beam over? No, that's okay, I'm wearing my plot armor. See you in a bit, I will walk xxxxxxx to the transporters and were taking the long way. xxxxxxx do you need to pack before going over to the ship?

I enjoy the show, but some easy corrections should have been put into a lot of these episodes. That's why the Mandalorian and the Orville are so good.

First we have Captain Cristobal Rios and the La Sirena, quickly followed by Seven and her ship, and now we Brooke and his ship.  Small, fast freighters with some defensive capabilities, with a flat asymmetrical design, that were meant to be multipurpose and all set for some adventure.

There is a fictional appeal of Han Soloists, the maverick captain with his small ship daring all the odds thrown against it.  I am not sure how it fits or still fits into Trek lore.  I don't know if there is some corporate pressure from the top to make shows more Star Warsy, or that more and more writers are internalizing Star Wars concepts and this is showing out unconsciously in their writing.   The maverick and his ship certainly goes beyond Star Wars, as we have seen from Whedon's Firefly, and the upcoming live action Cowboy Bebop.   Its almost a universal thing in space opera and a foundational trope.    With the Han Soloist you will see the accompaniment of a Wild West, like this region of space we see in Picard with the destitute Romulan colonists, with law and order held by Rangers.  In Discovery the Wild West has expanded virtually to everything else, except for well defended pockets of civilization.  

Does it contradict the internal realism of the lore?   In almost every space lore we should expect to see small craft piloted by a captain and a small crew.   Within the realistic confines of the Star Trek universe, we can expect such things to happen.  However, when relying on such devices, we take a risk with the show's special identity to avoid turning it to yet another space western.

Tos was famous for this.  With red shirts dropping like flies.  Lower decks is different in that when low ranking officers beam down they don't get killed as much.  Probably because they are main characters.  If they weren't they would likely be dead already.  Hell one of the senor officers has already been killed.  He was a jerk but at least he died a hero.  So I guess we won't be seeing the usual low ranking nameless officer get killed on away missions as much.

I had seen some of the Plinkett movie reviews and watched a portion of Star Trek IV around 2009 when I was 14. I was more of a Star Wars guy, albeit not a big fan.

But two years ago I started watching The Next Generation simply because I always found the show fascinating from the hilarious Plinkett reviews. And oh boy, was it easy to get into. I fell in love from episode one. Binged it through watching several episodes a day. Next I watched all the films. Then TOS. Then DS9. Then Voyager. Then Enterprise. Then the Kelvin movies. I even watched all the fan made episodes (New Voyages &amp; ST Continues)!

After all that, I can safely say that Star Trek has become my favorite franchise ever. Even though I'm only 25 and I just watched everything during the past 2 years, watching those old shows gives me a weird sense of nostalgia, it feels like I was there when the shows aired even though I wasn't. The stories of the shows and movies that spans several centuries is simply epic. The stories often give me a warm feeling since the vision of the future seems to positive, and most episodes end with a happy ending.

TOS is certainly my favorite show, and era. Many say it feels campy after over 50 years, but to me the series feels timeless, and still relevant today. I just love the 60's retro-futuristic atmosphere and the talents of Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, Doohan, Takei, Koenig and Nichols are simply fantastic. I never grow tired watching them on screen. My favorite movies are Wrath of Khan and Voyage Home.

My question is: how is khan and the other “super humans” or whatever they’re called in the original series so strong? If they were bred from eugenics how is it that (from a total of 47 odd years between ww2 and 1993 which only leaves a few generations) they already have “50 percent more efficient breathing” and are significantly smarter and stronger than “regular” humans?

Why then were the TNG movies so bad? They had more money, more time in between movies, the same writers, and the same cast, at least the first three do.

So why then do they suck so bad? Even if you like one or two of them (I like First Contact) you probably agree that even the best one doesn't live up to the standard the same cast and crew set with the show. 

I think the problem is precisely that it's the same crew and writers behind the show. A big problem the TNG movies share is that they feel like expensive TV Movies, and it's because they were done by TV people. 

Maybe if Rick Berman had given it to someone new while he focused on his TV Shows, we would've gotten what we did when Harve Bennett took over after Rodenberry. Then again that would've given him more time to interfere in DS9 so maybe it was for the best...

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start by saying that I'm not a huge Trekkie. I've watched most of TOS, TNG and Voyager, some ENT and 1st season of Discovery.

So if this is a stupid question, it's due to me not being too deep in the lore in general.

OK, with that out of the way, I'll elaborate on my question a bit.

Many races get design changes over the different series.

Consider for instance the Tribbles episode from TOS. The crew only realizes that one character is a Klingon after Bones took his temperature. Yet in later series, Klingons look very different and it's hard to believe that anyone would mistake a Klingon for a human.

A similar point can be made about Romulans. In the Neutral Zone, some of the crew project their hatred onto Spock, because Romulans and Vulcans look more or less the same. In later Series however, the two species look very much distinct.

I totally  get how much of this is due to budget and TOS being a little trashy in general. But how does canon cope with it? Are these things explained at all, and if yes, how so?

I am not just talking about the Vina reveal in the flashbacks I am talking about Pike's fate as well.

There is no mystery to why Spock is kidnaping his old Captain and stealing the ship.  I am glad that CBS all access is now including The Cage amongst their steaming service, despite that it never aired (I just wish they would have a production order option for ToS), I just think that it might make this episode a little redundant.

TOS had Spock, and only Spock, as the only non-human crew member (except for another Vulcan in the mirror universe.)  TMP had a forehead guy on the bridge, who didn't have much to do besides stand at his station.

TWOK brought in Saavik as a featured character.

TSFS moved Saavik over to the Grissom -- and Enterprise had a tall bald guy in the background of the Admiral Morrow scene (that guy could have been an import from Reliant).

TVH was a special case (no Enterprise for most of the movie), but there was the alien helmsman on Saratoga, and the alien comm officer at San Francisco HQ.

TFF had... nothing.  Except Spock.

TUC had that reptile guy on the Excelsior bridge, and the comic relief scene with Crewman Dax.

However, I was not sure why, and over time after first watching it in 2013 (and a couple of rewatches since) and trying to work out why the result is so effective, and have come to the conclusion that, for me, there are just many different emotions and reactions involved.

I have thought about this episode for way too long and can find many different interpretations that are compatible with each other. The more I think about it the more I am amazed, as each of the points below are also extremely powerful on their own. It's as if intended to merge multiple themes into one (whereas usually the episodic format limits them to 1).

Here they are for those interested:

* contentness with the knowledge that Kamin eventually found peace in his relationships and managed to carry on with his memories of Enterprise in the back of his mind, and that he led a calm and enjoyable life as Kamin

This also relates to Picard's backstory (never had children etc.), which people like to highlight, but I personally take a more abstract interpretation from this as it is quite a nice concept that things will eventually resolve themselves. However, his lack of prior family probably helped enable this.

* overwhelm at the point where he woke from the state

He finally discovers that all of the panic he felt at the start was genuine and he isn't mad, that his memories of the Enterprise are real etc. and that he had to spend years fighting against people telling him otherwise: he was right all along.

Throughout the episode you are left waiting for some kind of explanation to what is happening, and the reveal is beautiful imo.

* realisation that he was the sole person to be chosen to carry forward their memory.

There was uncertainty and suspicion at the beginning as to whether the probe is dangerous (brain rapes Picard; he feels kidnapped at first; also, the government guy is suspect). But as it turns out, the beam, nor his forced experience, was never malicious in the first place, and further to this, it self-destructed after its mission was complete. Their memory does not live on anywhere else.

So, there was only one probe, with a one-time use. There is surely something special about being selected to experience these memories with Picard.

* despair at the loss of their civilization due to the nova; all the characters you met over the last 40 minutes/years are suddenly long gone, it exploded more than 1000 years ago.

You experience all of Kamin's happy memories and are provided with a gist of the overall joy of Kamin's life, but his family is gone in an instant (and the whole planet). Their deaths are also greatly exacerbated by the fact it would have occurred far back into the past.

So any hope the viewer might have had of Picard somehow touching-base with them (virtually or otherwise) is hopeless, and you realize that very rapidly, which is pretty damn heartbreaking.

* even more despair at the fact they weren't able to do anything about the nova, but in particular that they didn't even attempt it because they knew it was so hopeless

The government supposedly lied about the rocket's purpose, to keep people's hopes up. It was a white lie to keep people's happy. This would have been an immensely heavy decision in itself and you feel for the leaders (regardless of whether it was correct).

The self-reveal of his family saying 'remember us' towards the end makes this even more damming. There was nothing they could do.

* peace in the knowledge that they must have all died together, painlessly, and instantly, and they collectively knew it was coming.

In the self-reveal they were smiling and had accepted their fate. They could be seen to be making the most of their situation even with death in sight (which we recognise as an incredible achievement, so it follows that we are extremely impressed, but they just in an incredibly weak position, so this is also heartbreaking.

* realisation that the same thing might happen to our Solar System some day (or human extinction through some other means) so therefore we should be making the most of everything, and Kamin's main quote (to his daughter) is this exactly, For me, this whole theme (or the effect if unintentional) is so immensely powerful that it forces me reflect on my life, intense periods of good and bad events, etc!

And then the flute at the end! He is feeling sad knowing the civilization is in the past... but also happy to have experienced it as Kamin.... but also likely desperately missing Kamin's family - moreover, though, he is generally respecting their (and our?) civilization at the same time!

The above is all stating the obvious but it's just stunning! If the multi-layering was intentional, then it is also genius.

Incoming Rant. Raise your shields.
I have benn following several Star Trek related both sites like Trekmovie, TrekCore and fan accounts for years.
And everyone posts screenshots from teaser clips befoe episodes airs.
And this is really getting on my nerves. Screenshots from trailers are ok-ish. But from clips without spoiler warning is ridicilous and taking all the joy from watching an episode. I or anyone else have to see these clips. Or trailers for that matter. 
People who posts these shots should be more considirate.
Speking of, TrekCore is really guilty of spoiling episodes for releasing shots when only show released only on US, not the day after it released worldwide on Netflix or Amazon. 
Not everyone has to watch these instantly... Like trailers or clips.

If you have argument against this, please be polite.

I think that's a very good thing for a few reasons:

1. *Her personality is realistic.* I know people like her - confident, witty, good at what they do, but they don't want to admit when they need help...until they crack under pressure. 
2. *She has flaws, and learns from them*. I think the way she snapped at Stamets in the dinner party scene was well written and was like a lot of arguments in the real world, and by including a character who struggles with stress and what appears to be some PTSD, Star Trek is shining a light on issues that don't get talked about but affect a lot of people. Also, showing her recognize that she wasn't okay and going to talk to Culber about it really encourages people watching who may be struggling with their own mental health issues to get help if they need it.
3. Finally, on the flip side of that, *she's a really good pilot*. Her ""full manual control"" flying scene in ""The Sanctuary"" was pretty darn cool. I got big Star Wars vibes from that whole part of the episode (in the best way possible), as well as her cocky attitude afterwards - which was a fun contrast to the other characters we've seen on the show so far. The conversation between her and Ryn was nice, too - how she used her own experience with stress to relate to him and get him to help her (and having Grudge along for the ride made the scene even better).

Overall, Discovery NEEDS its side characters, and at least in my opinion, they're the best part of the season right now - I much prefer hearing about what the bridge crew are up to than another Burnham and Book episode. For this reason, underdeveloped characters like Detmer getting attention in episodes are really helping make this series more well-rounded. Nice job to Emily Coutts for bringing this character to life during the new season - here's hoping this pattern continues and the rest of Disco's bridge crew get their moment in the spotlight!

I'm a hardcore Star Trek fan and a huge A/V aficionado. Somehow I missed the news a few years ago that a 4K UltraHD HDR10 remaster was made. A disc version was never released, but at least the digital streaming version is currently available for purchase. It's GLORIOUS! Me and my OLED are very happy right now.

**Notable Thoughts**

* Early scene where Kirk emerges after Saavik fails the Kobayashi Maru test; the light behind Kirk is incredibly bright and wonderful.
* Early scene where Kirk and Spock are standing in the hallway after the Kobayashi Training; there's a giant glass globe-thing that has etchings on it -- a level of detail I've never seen before.
* Enterprise in space dock and leaving space dock: 'nuff said.
* Regula One exterior shots are really, really crisp.
* Mutara Nebula exterior scenes: there's extra brilliance in the color, and bright bursts of light (nebula lightning, both the Enterprise and Reliant's ship lights) all really pop.
* Spock messing around with the warp core reactor tore into my retina.
* Little details like computer terminal commands and wall inscriptions are now legible.
* Not A/V related but this is the Director's Cut which I hadn't seen since the old DVD days.

**Some Bummers**

* There are a few scenes where the camera misfocused and the 4k footage exposes the errors. For example, Kirk's facial reaction after drinking Romulan Ale with McCoy.
* Some of the computer graphics at the time, like the 3 Klingon Ships as well as the Genesis Project video, all look incredibly dated. Unlike the TOS Remastered project, the TWOK remaster didn't ""re-create"" computer graphics.
* Paramount hasn't remastered any of the other TOS movies. :(
* The movie is nearly 40 years old and about half the movie's cast has passed away. :(
* RIP Scotty's movie nephew. :(",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,269807,public,self,PSA to AV enthusiasts: The Wrath of Khan Director's Cut is available in 4K UHD with HDR10 on iTunes and VUDU.

However, once we finish Star Trek IV, I don't know if we should jump into TNG and watch Star VI when we watch Unification, or if we should see VI before we watch TNG.

VI before TNG obviously makes some sense because it's a direct sequel to the TOS movies and you won't know how it would end with the Klingons (seeing Worf spoils that). But then again, that's how everyone in the 1990s saw it.

However a quick google search doesn't seem to give me any info and memory alpha / beta weren't much help.

Does anyone have more info about this ship or know where I could find more info about it?

Also if there are some wall papers I could download that would be amazing!!!

But I submit it is possible Riker always kept the power and just hid it from that point on.

This explains many of the implausible rescues and missions the Enterprise will go on to have over the rest of their years as well as Riker's success with the ladies. 

Further near the end of Star Trek: Generations Riker flat out tells Picard that he (Riker) plans to live forever. A very unusual statement from a mortal Starfleet officer. Even Kirk knew he'd die one day.

Now I believe it is possible Riker is responsible for ""The Burn"" in Discovery. A jaded. angry Riker taking revenge on the Federation he feels caused the death of this son (from the events of the Nepenthe episode of Picard.) 

End of season bad guy will be Michael Burnham vs. Will Riker for the fate of the galaxy.

The Kardassians have still not fully recovered from the previous war against the Federation, they have been dealing with the Maquis, they lost a major part  of their fleet in their assault on the changelings and they were being *pummeled* by the Klingons.
(Dukat even admits as much in the episode)

How are 2 of  the 3 dominant powers in the alpha quadrant not able to keep up with them? Speaking of which, where are the Romulans? Do they just conveniently forget about the Dominion threat? There is no way in hell they would ignore a threat like the Dominion, they are supremacists after all.

In star trek they have shootouts almost every episode.  Not to mention dangerous space anomalies that can rip a ship to shreds.  The only remotely safe areas are planets that either have ships guarding them or a planetary defense grid.  And even most of those places are really dangerous.  So space is a near constant war between many different hostile aliens.  It's total chaos.  If someone made a video showing all of the combat situations in star trek it would be a long video.  And if someone made a list of all the ways to die in space it would be a very long list.  So space is so dangerous that I'm surprised most people aren't like no I'm not going out there it's insane.  The people who do travel through space are either really stupid or really brave or both.  So space makes the wild west look peaceful.  Because it's so dangerous.

The suspense and drama you can get from a show starring Filipa Georgiou and *bald evil guy* and Ash Tyler is through the roof. These are some of the best characters written for Star Trek, especially Michelle Yeoh, forget the old shows.

Section 31 encapsulates the new Star Trek. It's got gritty, poor worlds. It's a future filled with alcohol, casinos and black markets - outlaws fighting for what's theirs!

We really need more of that gritty gore &amp; realism. We live in a bleak era and Star Trek needs to reflect that. Finally the shows are catching on. 

*Picard* already did this beautifully as an immigration allegory, and turned out to be one of the best Star Trek shows apart from other nu-Trek.

Enough of this blue eyed idealism, it's time for action. Fast fights, fast dialogue, evil villains - morally grey main characters that may be genocidal but are also cool --- all of that is encapsulated in Section 31.

If Section 31 need to infiltrate some Planet that have some Teleport Protection like Discovery Episode 08. I have an Solution

- Sure the easiest way out would be to Land an cloaked Shuttle or Ship. Easy

- But if they would detect this?

- Well this kind of Teleport Protection was similar to an WLan or Radio Signal Scrambler, right? 

- What would ""PC Nerds"" do, if there are to many WLan interferences? Right. They switch back to LAN Cable. 

- So they shoot an Teleport capsule from the Ship or Capsule to the surface linked with an thick protected ""Teleportation LAN"" cable. Of course the Cable must resist or block these interferences. 

In sort: They got ""Teleport Lift"" with Cable solution. 

This can be used if there is no place to land the Shuttle or Ship, of course if they can penetrate the force fields

- This is some sort of Airborne Rangers in Star Trek OPS way. No need to look if there are atmosphere for Parachutes use. Also this goes way faster (No need to Sky Jump like in Kelvin Timeline)

- Send an independent Capsule down that ""create"" Tools for the mission from its Database, like Weapons (Inspiration took out from Games ""Where do the unwieldy Weapons go?"" solution) and stuff. They can Fail safe protect the access if it falls into enemy hands

I bought a Beta copy of Star Trek - The Motion Picture.

I then bought another copy but on Beta - HiFi, that had stereo sound.

When my Beta VCR died, I bough a VHS - HiFi copy.

Then I bought the VHS wide screen release.

Then I bought the directors cut, still on VHS.

Plenty of people speculated it could have been Iconians, or some extra-dimensional beings, but given how closed the bubble of the plot is, of course it was going to be Burnham. 

Ultimately, the burn will either be caused by Discovery travelling through time or Burnham sending the time suit back into the wormhole to self-destruct. It's far too easy. All the theories concerning the Omega particle, Q, a super weapon, etc., they venture too far outside the bubble of of the plot and how the show rotates its narrative. Burnham is the centre of that narrative- if she isn't the cause of a problem, then she is the ultimate solution.

It ends up being both predictable and boring, and it's one of the inherent issues of presenting these large-scale mysteries in a show that largely revolves around one person. If the mystery of the plot doesn't personally concern the main character, it's easy for the audience to get disconnected from the plot or ask the question 'why should the main character get involved'? 

One show that did this well was Mr Robot, but for an entirely different reason and one that I won't discuss at length because I wouldn't want to spoil the show for those who hadn't seen it. Long story short, the main character, Elliot, does something that he believes is right after a lot of internal fighting about whether or not it was right to do (and that many people would initially believe is right), and after the thing happens he realises that there were many repercussions that were outside his control and that there were powers at play banking on his success. In Mr Robot, the plot is solely Elliot's story, how he affects his friends and family, and how he finds justice for the wrongs in his life. He's always playing catch-up and attempting to out-maneouvre those who would use his actions for their own gain.

Fortunately for Mr Robot, it never had a big mystery to solve, but rather a continuous slow burn (no pun intended) of Elliot fighting the interests of the other players. Unfortunately for Discovery, there doesn't seem to be much of a parallel in terms of drawn out plot or story outside of Burnham's centrality to the story. 

And I get that people will be mad at this post and react strongly. That's fine, there's a very wild and disturbing insanity on either side of the debate as to whether or not a person likes Discovery or if it's a 'good' show, but I encourage everyone to think of how disconnected the episodes have generally been outside of Burnham's screen time. For instance, what happened to the guy who sat at the same desk for 40 years? Why doesn't Admiral Vance retrofit all the other Starfleet ships with the spore drive (besides removing Discovery's pivotal nature to the plot)? Communication consistency within the show has made no sense, with ships/worlds either able to communicate through subspace or not. Why would a ship from the 23rd century have plant seeds from 'the whole galaxy' if the whole galaxy hadn't been explored then, and why would it be placed near a star? Why didn't Earth know about anything happening within their own solar system?

The reality of all these questions is that each story is just a way by which Discovery fixes things. After all, what better way to end the season after building up so much goodwill than to have everyone discover it was the time suit that caused the burn in the first place?

The producers and writers visit this sub. It's why they've dived into making SNW, because they think it'll satisfy some nostalgic craving for the 'good old days' of episodic stories. We don't want nostalgia; we want coherent, intelligent stories that don't continually hinge on the same person solving the problem. No more, no less.

1. United Earth Defense Force - with Earth having become a somewhat isolationist entity post-burn, I’d love to see some of the conflicts they’ve been involved in, either before or after Discovery’s visit. Obviously a bit harder to do proper exploration, but the Sol System is a big place without warp drive.

2. Generation Ship - In episode 3.4, we learn that Adira reached Earth on a generation ship, and I think it would be cool to see some of that journey. Of course, seeing as Adira is being pretty well fleshed out on DSC proper, it might make sense to focus on the ship at a different time, or a different ship altogether. Either way, sub-light interstellar travel opens up a ton of opportunities, and I can imagine the series working kinda like BSG, where there’s an overall story and premise, but most episodes focus on various logistical issues that pop up on a centuries long journey.

3. The life of a Courier - This would definitely risk treading into the same territory as The Mandalorian, but it feels like the best way to really explore the post-burn galaxy - a lone mercenary or small crew looking for dilithium and checking out all kinds of planets and civilizations.

The Klingons Houses have a similiar Structure to the Various Japanese Clans during the Feudal period. 

Mauk-to'Vor seems to be similiar to Seppuku, which was a form of sucide that would restore honor to their clan. 

Bajorn Religon = Christianity

Now this is my opinion, I have no idea if I'm right or wrong but heres my reasoning.

The Bajorians have Religous Texts that are like the Verses in the Bible

The Emissary is like Jesus Christ. He sacrifice himself to save everyone else.

Sisko and Quark respond to Jake going into the holodecks like they're porn-booths when literally EVERYONE uses the holodeck for non-sexual purposes? From TNG and Voyager we see Wesley skiing down snowy peaks with his friends in the Holodeck, O'Brien and Julian playing army-men, even Neelix taking a little Naomi into one to play Kadis-Kot. okay those last are all bad examples, but you get my point right?

Why does Sisko think that Jake's date is going to ""get the wrong idea"" if Jake invites her to play baseball on the Holodeck when she's probably got her own holodeck programs she's been running since she was a kid? If it were some sort of cultural evolution where Holodecks were childrens toys back in TNG up until before the Voyager crew got transported across the Galaxy where the stresses of war began to take priority over drinking Romulan Ale with Vikings, then shouldn't it be Jake warning Benjamin against taking Kassidy into the holodecks instead of Sisko warning Jake about the ""risque"" nature of the holodeck?

More indication of the affect and influence Star Trek had on people is the large number of fan made films that have been produced. Some of these productions must have had a significant amount of financing to be made, with some including professional actors.

See what you think, agree, disagree, remember your favourite episodes!*

Perhaps you want to watch *Picard* or *Star Trek: Discovery*, but you ""probably should check out some of the older stuff first"". Maybe you've always been curious about *Star Trek: The Next Generation* but ""that's a lot of episodes to get through...who has the time?"". Or you watched the series when you were younger, and want to go back to it, but you're wary of *those* really bad episodes along the way.

In any case, I have a guide to help you. Other people have delivered their verdicts on whether each episode is worth your time. I have gone a little further. So much of the *Next Gen* is golden - or at least a well-crafted silver - but I have reduced the 7 seasons down to what I consider to be the very best episodes. 

This list includes only **30** of the 178 episodes in the series.  If each episode is 45 minutes long, that means that you have less than 23 hours of *Next Gen* remaining. Even then, I've suggested a few that you could skip (but would be mad to do so). I've also \*\*\*highlighted\*\*\* what I believe are five of the very best episodes. If you only want to take a quick dip in the *Star Trek* pool, you can be in and out in under 4 hours.

There may be some gaps in your understanding (Where did that character go? How did that character come back?) but recaps are built into the dialogue of every TV series. This list is about getting you the best, most important bits.

**Season 1** \- 4 Episodes  
**Episode 1 &amp; 2 - Encounter at Farpoint** \- It certainly makes sense to start at the beginning, and these two episodes set you up with what the crew (and the ship) are all about. You'll also see the show at the bizarre end of its sci-fi spectrum, with the all-powerful entity known as Q. He is the most antagonising of antagonists, and he just loves to play god with *The Enterprise.*  
**Episode 26 - The Neutral Zone** \- aaaand then skip right to the end of Season 1. No, really. You want the abridged version? Here it is. There are many great moments in the first season (and some horrendous ones...) but it hasn't really made it's mark yet. The final episode is a step up though. You get a look at the Romulans, a species with espionage practically built into their DNA. You'll also get to see everyone on the crew at their best, and get a real taste of how the two main officers on the crew make such a great partnership.

**Season 2** \- 4 Episodes  
**Episode 8 - A Matter of Honor** \- now that you've seen a little Romulan, have a whole heap of Klingon, the drunken-pub-fight empire. Riker, the ship's second-in-command, is temporarily assigned to a Klingon ship for reasons, and he must embrace their violent and cut-throat lifestyle to survive. He does, and it's *really* fun to watch.  
**\*\*\*****Episode 9 - The Measure of a Man\*\*\*** \- this is my first favourite on this list. Why? Well, nothing happens. No phasers and fired, no one throws a punch, there is zero peril. *It is, on the other hand*, entirely captivating. You also get to really see one key element of the show: really good acting that elevates the source material. This episode is 'only' concerned with the question of whether or not Data, the ship's android, is alive or not. The court case that ensues is a delight.  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 16 - Q Who \*\*\*** \- oh man, this is the other reason I love *Sta*r *Trek*. The episode starts with the return of the reality-bending Q, who amuses himself at the crew's expense... before drawing back the astral curtain to reveal one of the (in my opinion) best villains/monsters in all science-fiction. If you don't know The Borg, well I don't want to spoil too much. Visually they are somewhere between goofy and creepy (as only TV monsters can be) but in terms of villainy they tick a lot of boxes. It's the air of inevitable doom that does it for me.  
**Episode 20 - The Emissary** \- *Next Generation* likes to occasionally attempt a romantic story, and it usually falls flat. Either the affair is sickeningly sweet, or one or more of the people involved comes across like a sex-pest. In this case, the romance is fun to watch. On one side, a human-raised Klingon officer desperately clinging to tradition, and on the other is a half-human, half-Klingon with a firm belief in being true to yourself. It's an *angry*\-passion, and it's delicious. The rest of the episode is also great. 

**Season 3** \- 6 Episodes  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 10 - The Defector \*\*\*** \-  *Next Gen* hits a confident stride in season 3, almost every episode is wonderful. This one is an absolute gem. Intergalactic politics, Romulan shenanigans, twist and turns, high-grade acting. All tremendous.   
**Episode 13 - Déjà Q** \- if you're not a fan of Q by now, skip this one. If like me, you enjoy his brand of megalomania, this is a truly fun time. This isn't about him causing a problem though; this time it's all about Q. His arrogance, his vulnerabilities and his total lack of empathy.   
**Episode 15 - Yesterday's Enterprise** \- if you've followed this guide up until now, there's a bit of continuity missing for this episode. A main character made a surprising (and underwhelming) exit in an earlier season, and wibbly wobbly time allows for a reappearance. Nonetheless, this is a superb story about trying to reset a broken timeline, only to cause more cracks to appear.  
**Episode 17 - Sins of the Father** \- I swear I've not put every Worf episode on this list, but some of the best political wrangling and tensest character moments take place in the Klingon-centric episodes. This one tells you more about the angry, war-driven, assassin-filled society than any previous instalment.  
**Episode 23 - Sarek** \- there's a lot of emotions in this one. You... have to see the episode to know why that's actually a very clever line... um... so anyway, at its core this is an episode about a brilliant, intelligent, widely respected person who refuses to accept his senility. It hits a lot of emotional points, and hits them hard. The acting is sensational too. The scenery is comprehensibly chewed.  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 26 - The Best of Both Worlds, Part I \*\*\*** \- *this* is how you end a series. Again, you might just watch this and the next episode and get the best image of *Next Gen*. I will say no more about it, other than to say...

**Season 4** \- 4 Episodes  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 1 - The Best of Both Worlds, Part II \*\*\*** **-** ...both these episodes rule.  
**Episode 7 - Reunion** \- If you're not a Klingon fan like myself, or you weren't that into the romance story in '*The Emissary*', then you could step past this. If you enjoy the angry love and Klingon politics, you'll want this episode. It's another episode aiming for your emotions, so be warned.  
**Episode 24 - The Mind's Eye** \- It's the *Machurian Candidate* in space. Brainwashing and murder. Fun fun fun.  
**Episode 26 - Redemption, Part I** \- Even if you're only watching the episodes on this list, you will by now see all the elements that make *Star Trek* great. Political intrigue and back-stabbing, complex alien cultures, fun twists-and-turns, acting greater than a sci-fi TV series ever needs. This two-parter has all those elements, woven together with great skill. *Next Generation* certainly knows...

**Season 5** \- 5 Episodes  
**Episode 1 - Redemption, Part II** \- ...how to get you hooked for the next season.  
**Episode 3 - Ensign Ro** \- Ro is a character that should have gone somewhere, but the actor wanted to go somewhere else. Nevertheless, this is a intriguing episode that proves that not everyone in Starfleet is a goody-two-shoes, and tackles the topic of 'refugee crisis' in a fascinating way that stays clear of heavy handed messages.  
**Episode 18 - Cause and Effect** \- Every sci-fi worth its salt has a time loop episode. This take on the concept is one of the best, because there isn't one person reliving each day in detail. Instead the *whole crew* feels the creeping panic of the most intense deja vu, but never fully remembers what is happening when things reset. Luckily, this crew is super smart.  
**Episode 23 - I, Borg** \- A single Borg drone is disconnected from the collective and held on the *Enterprise*. Rather than punting the thing into space (which Picard would happily do right from the start), the crew decides to experiment. All good stuff.  
**Episode 25 - The Inner Light** \- you *could* skip this episode. The only aspect of the *Enterprise* involved in this story is Picard. It's a standalone story. You *should* absolutely watch this episode, however, because it is a wonderfully emotional and captivating story. If you're off to watch *Picard* after this, *The Inner Light* will make the captain's life story so much more compelling.

**Season 6** \- 4 Episodes  
**Episode 10 - Chain of Command, Part I** \- imagine watching a show for six seasons, and then they changed the main character mid season. You'd find it hard to watch. Well, that's actually a deliberate point of this episode. The *Enterprise* is needed for a special mission, and a militaristic, regimented officer temporarily takes over the ship. And Picard? He and his officers go special ops for a brief spell...  
**Episode 11 - Chain of Command, Part II** …which leads into an episode that I will say nothing about, except that this one is very hard to watch, but in a very good way.  
**Episode 14 - Face of the Enemy** \- Troi, the ship's counsellor, has to pretend to be a Romulan. I've skipped a lot of Troi-centred episodes (and some were *very* easy to skip) but this one deserves your attention, and has some of the best political chicanery so far.  
**Episode 21 - Frame of Mind** \- an episode where nothing is what it seems, everything is a lie, where even the plot twists may/may not be make-believe. Just wonderful. 

**Season 7**  4 Episodes  
**Episode 11 - Parallels** \- huh... if your following this list, then you're watching two reality-bending episodes in a row. They are widely different concepts, with a focus on different crew members. Honestly, this entire episode is worth it for a brief Riker vs Riker moment at the very end.  
**Episode 12 - The Pegasus** \- so much of season 7 is actually quite mediocre, without a lot to add to the legacy of the series. This episode is a big diamond in the rough. Oodles of slow-burning tension, officers questioning right and wrong, lies and mysteries between friends and one of the cutest moments between Picard and Riker you'll ever see.  
**Episode 25 &amp; 26 - All Good Things…** \- Having taken the shorter road to the end, these last two episodes may not feel as significant. They certainly aren't the best episodes on this list. It's some of the biggest and boldest sci-fi you'll see, but it might also leave you a bit winded. What is important, at least to me, is that these two episodes demonstrate one of the rare times that a science fiction TV show goes out with grace. Some try for one last season and fall flat, others are shut down before they can even say 'conclusion'.  *Star Trek: The Next Generation* brings in Q to bookend the series, raises the stakes to the highest degree, before delivering a beautifully tender final scene that is just right.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**  
I watched most of *Star Trek: The Next Generation* when I was younger, and recently revisited the whole series and the movies before taking a run at *Picard*. Reflecting on all the episodes this way really reinforces how much of this show is just so much fun. The majority of episodes are full of interesting moral dilemmas, political mysteries, inspired science fiction and wonderful acting.

I did feel a bit guilty about some of the episodes culled. There's a two-part story where Spock shows up, removing those made me feel cruel. If you disagree with my choices, and think that other episodes should be on this list, well... isn't that just further proof of how great this series is? Let us know!

I would, of course, recommend you watch the whole thing, if you have time. Or at least, *most* of it. Maybe I'll do another list of the absolutely skippable episodes. You know, like the one with implied ghost-human intercourse... or the one where the writer's tried to make a statement about apartheid and ended up being weirdly sexist... or when a virus makes the crew lose all their inhibitions...

I live in LA, I am liberal, more classic liberal, but not a conservative. I loved Star Trek for its diversity since the first episode of TNG. I was still a kid then and didn't understand many things. I understand many more things these days, but one thing I will never understand is forced equality,. I was born in USSR. I know what equality of opportunity is vs. equality of outcome. You can't force equality to appease people and that's what Discovery has done. I've suffered through this terrible series because I love Star Trek and now I am just catching up with seasons 3. I don't like watching 1 episode at a time so I am watching the first 8 (not sure how many were shot for Season 3). Besides the simple fact that there are no white males anywhere to be seen, besides the fact that all the positions of power are help by women, besides the horrible writing, this is NOT Star Trek. Don't get me this BS about previous ST was about diversity. I know what ST was, is, and is not, and this is not ST. It's garbage. Look at DS9 or Voyager. I never even thought about it because it was given that those places are going to be diverse. Discovery doesn't let me forget that white men are bad and don’t belong here. (Google Straight White Men Incompetent Discovery). You want to get triggered, call me names, or bring your sorry excuses for why I am wrong, totally fine, but I am right and I've realized how many people (men, women, etc.) all feel the same. This is NOT even close to being Star Trek. Funny enough, Orville is more ST than this sorry iteration of Star Trek. How dare they pervert Star Trek? The only thing is shares with Star Trek is the name and certain references.

So why not have a ""where are they now?"" Sort of show. It would need to be animated, as these actors have all aged or passed on, or in some cases are too expensive. But imagine, 10/13 episodes to do an X years later sequel series. You could do this with the following:

Enterprise: show the final days of the romulan war, and the birth of the federation

Tos: after TAS, finish the fifth year of this crews voyage, and have them return home

TMP/Tff: There's big time jumps for the movies, and there are unseen adventures following The motion picture, and in the gap before The undiscovered country. Definitely a possibility

TNG: Show us a prequel series for Picard, and his rise through the Starfleet ranks. 

DS9: None of the ds9 crew have been touched sine nemesis, so it's clear to me there's a plan for them. Even though certain cast members are now gone, animation would be an honourable way to carry on their Legacies

VOY: How does this crew settle back into alpha quadrant life? What happens to voyager when Janeway leaves? What breaks up chakotay and seven, and drives her away? Does Kim ever get a promotion!?

Kelvin timeline: the expensive cast was the reason this was cancelled, so new voice actors, and a slashed animated budget would solve both those problems, and provide a litmus test into whether this universe is worth keeping around

First off ditching the Prime Directive (which had always unnecessarily held back the Enterprise and it's crew) we get an actual proper survey mission planetside in an appropriate vehicle for the job (dune buggy of course) and when a group of hostiles in the Argo scene fire at them they do the right thing and actually fire back and don't take shit from some aggressive assholes. This followed by the introduction of Shinzon and the awesome Scimitar followed by Picard, always being a bit more diplomatic than aggressive try and talk some sense into the man. But instead we get a full half hour of combat that only some parts of DS9 might match, up to and including just full on ramming the EE in a move of desperation. And to top it off we get Picard finally just flat out impaling Shinzon with an iron rod and Data going out in a blaze of glory. This was not only a great way to end the TNG arc but by far the best ST movie in general.

Adira’s pronoun scene. Ok sure, that’s appropriate and relevant in 2020. So no problem. There is a scene at the end of the episode though, with Hugh, Paul, and Adira that felt awfully contrived. It’s as though there was this deliberate attempt to cram as many they’s and their’s into the dialogue as possible. It wasn’t necessary. It didn’t add to the story. It was just a ham-fisted way of overstating the point. 

I like that the writers are carrying on the tradition of making progressive social statements through Trek. They could learn a few lessons from TOS and DS9.

\- Nick Fury had half his face blown off by Kodos or something?  And has to wear a black mask over half it now?  ...In the time of Star Trek, they can't do better than doctors today can with a skin graft or whatever?  Bummer.

\- Roddenberry predicted so much of the future correctly... but the computer can't merge the two photos of Kodos or compare them for similar points?  Kirk has to rely on FEELINGS instead (surprise - it's a Kirk specialty!)

\- Lenore Karidian (Kodos' daughter) is supposed to be 19 years old. NINETEEN.  She's still barely a teenager, and she's 30-something-year-old Kirk's love interest for the episode.  Rewatching today (and not as a kid to whom everyone over 15 seemed ""old"") this just looks creepy.  ""You cared about her, didn't you?"" McCoy asks at the end.  ""Yes, doctor.  I knew her for five minutes but she had really dreamy eyes and a kicking figure.""

\- I still have no idea how to make sense of star dates.  I'm pretty sure they're just randomly-generated numbers.

\- Dr. McCoy is the worst friend ever (and probably not great at his job) when Mr. Spock comes looking for advice and all Bones can do is drink and suggest that Kirk has the hots for the 19-year-old.  ""If you won't join me, at least don't judge me... until you've tried it!""

\- ""All the power of this ship, surging and throbbing... Are you like that captain?""  Ugh.  Pretty porno for 1960s TV, wasn't that?

\- Kodos killed half of his people because he thought there weren't enough resources to go around?  ...So THIS is where Thanos got the idea.

\- Nichelle Nichols has a beautiful voice.  But that song went on for a looong time.

\- Don't drink the milk, Riley!  Someone sprayed it with an old plastic spray bottle full of Windex or something!  ...That spray bottle sure took me out of the moment.

\- If Anton Karidian WASN'T Kodos, he sure is a suspicious-seeming dick to Captain Kirk when he comes to question him.  Way to make yourself look innocent, pal.

\- It's really too bad that this is the last episode with Lt. Riley.  He was a good character, and I would've liked to see more of him.  I might even take him over Chekov.

\- Ok, let's revisit Barbara Anderson as Lenore: she played super cray-cray bonkers pretty damned well.  Kudos to Kodos!  Or, er, Kodos' kiddo.

OVERALL: there's a reason I rarely rewatch this episode.  Is it anyone's favorite?  I'd love to hear why if so.  This is a middling 5/10 from me.

One thing is certain: money does not exist in the Federation.

There are many ways justifications for this, but let’s end one right here. It is NOT a Post-Scarcity society. Yes, replicators exist in Star Trek, but they only existed in Next Generation and not in the original series. The original series only had protein synthesizers. So the moneyless society of the Federation existed before replicators were invented. Also, some things can’t be replicated: Dilithium, which is a power source for warp-drives, and (ugh) Latinum.

So the Federation’s economy gets along fine without money or endless resources. Additionally, we are shown that people on earth can seemingly own vast tracts of land, like Picard’s brother with his French vineyard.

Several economic systems can manage this:

1.	⁠an advanced version of the commons (I’m not an expert on this), where people can just pick up and own whatever they have. This may be the reason there are several colonies on other planets: lack of space on earth made them find new places to live. A single dude could own his own planet.

2.	⁠Cooperation and negotiation: there are many names for this, but essentially the distribution of resources is negotiated by individuals. It’s never shown, but perhaps Kirk, Picard and McCoy all debate on who gets what room at the Federation Hotel Kaiser-5, instead of it going to the person with the most money. I’d imagine it could get very bureaucratic, such as needing to write a letter to the city council if you want to get a 2-acre beet farm.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,269452,public,self,Star Trek’s economy isn’t that complicated or mysterious,0,[],0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k6zqe3/star_treks_economy_isnt_that_complicated_or/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are about to watch Discovery Season 3 Episode 8. The show is 'enjoyable' and worthy of watching. But does it invoke the same sense of caring about the characters at ANY of the past ST series? I don't think so. I've tried to care about this woman that out of the blue is Spock's adopted sister that the entire series orbits about. Really I have... maybe too hard but I'm sincere.

My level of caring about any of the players in Discovery is LESS than it is for ANY of the new characters that, by season 3, I found myself relating to in ANY of the previous series. I'm watching it because it is 'Star Trek' but I'm not finding myself drawn in. At times I feel like I'm watching one of the 'Transformers' movies where the action is so non-stop your eyes sort of blur and you zone out.

Surely someone out there feels the same way. I'm not disrespecting the series. I'm just saying, from a buy-in standpoint, is the lessor of any that preceded it.

I have HIGH hopes for 'ST: Strange New Worlds'. Seeing Captain Pike walk onto the updated Enterprise was the most emotion I've felt across all three seasons.

Sure it’s not the show at it’s peak but I’ve liked all the episodes.

and now I'm wishing they'd done some subplot about a cover-up of this fact. I tend to get annoyed with over-use of Section 31, but protecting the tactical advantage of being able to teleport at the cost of sacrificing everyone who teleports(since it DOES replace them with a perfect copy) seems like EXACTLY the kind of mission they'd have.

The best scifi teleporter I've ever seen, in regards to ""do you die or not from this?"" is Dark Matter(a fucking CRIME that that show got cancelled). The way that one works, is you go into a coma, and a perfect copy of you is created at your destination. That copy does whatever it is you need to do over there, and then gets back into the pod, where it is deconstructed(and yeah, the clone would be aware that it was gonna die when this was all over), and then the new memories it generated are written into your brain.

*''All I heard when I was little was how deceitful the Federation was. How they'd turn on you.* ***You want to scare an Andorian child, tell them they're going to a Federation Summer Camp***\*'\*'.    - Ryn

I believe the Federation really messed up on caring about the individual planet's (this almost happened once to Andoria in Memory Beta content) needs &amp; what RYn says is a result of that. Granted he was born into the Emerald Chain, and the Orions were always shown as antagonistic to the Federation; but a century can't drastically change the opinion molded for a Millenia unless something truly serious happened. (And how on \[insert planet\] did Andorians team up with the Orions)

The first 2 sentences that Ryn says make sense in the 32nd Century, said either due to influence by Orions or even by the Federation's actions (exploiting you for the needs of many may seem like turning on you). But children being scared doesn't happen through tales about deceitful, untrustworthy or uncaring entities, it happens through stories of an evil, scary or ''bad'' entities. This probably means the Federation went even crazier on Andoria than the Ni'varrans (as it is unlikely they were scared of it), making themselves see mlike the bad guy.

And mostly smooth sailing from then. TNG is a prime example, but it also applies to Voyager, DS9 and Enterprise. The only ones exempt from this rule are TOS, which had only 3 seasons and seemed like a rollercoaster of quality up and down until a lesser S3, and TAS, which basically has 1 season, but it's split 16/6 across both seasons weirdly

Anyway, The term ""growing the beard"" is obviously a reference to how Riker grew a beard for Season 2 of TNG, which coincidently resulted in a better season for TNG. And I think Discovery has grown it's beard

The first season was mixed to say the least. I hold to my heart that Magic to make the sanest man go mad is one of the great time travel episodes in the franchise, and the characters are mostly all charming and likeable, but their journey is more of a slow walk through mud. We spend half of it in the mirror universe, part of it is all about Burnham's disobedience, and then the rest is sort of just filler between those two beats. And the Enterprise arrival at the end seems to be a begging to entice the show to be renewed (if it wasn't already BTS) just like the Best of Both Worlds before it. But instead of pulling this card after 3 seasons, they're pulling it right out of the gate? 

The second season is a major shift though, we get the show being embedded into the star trek universe, more familiar faces and places show up, and Pike literally kicks the crew into being... well... a crew. We get discussions of faith like New Eden, classical throwbacks like If Memory Serves, and a season wide mystery about the red angels. It still hangs onto some of the weaker elements of the first season, like Tyler and the Klingons, but the new stuff is more than enticing.

Then the third season had a lot to prove. Was this raise in quality a product of bringing in these legacy characters like Pike? Or better quality on the show? And it seems to be the latter. Now I thought the first episode was a disappointment. It seemed like it was the Zany Michael from the first season all over again, throw in a few action scenes, and that's it. But starting with the second episode, we get that Volta with the time jump, we see the emotional effects of their journey, we get resolution to story arcs 30 years in the making, they develop these characters further in both their weakness and their strengths, they have a mission, they have a mystery, and god damn you know they're gonna solve it. Every episode except the first has been a rollercoaster for me. And SARU man, finally he gets his long-overdue promotion and he is already surpassed numerous other main cast captains. Sure, it's his first days of captaincy, but he accepts the role in full swing, and is more than competent. He is not afraid to sanction his officers, but he's not going to ignore their personal lives like Picard either. He is driven by protecting and discovering, but he's not going to break every rule in the book to get to that point like a few captains we've known. 

It's clear now why the show is renewed for Season 4 and filming, and now we can get a better picture of why CBS want this baby to run the whole 7 seasons. If you want to move the franchise forward, it helps to have the show move forward in time, like literally all the other series apart from ENT before it, which arguably was such a step back in time, that Trek lost it's footing and fell over. Now in the future, they can write their own future without being bound by TOS edging closer and closer.

I really tried with discovery twice now. The leap forward fixed the glaring issue with plot that I hated (though I would live to see what they'll do with klingon aesthetics in this future lmao).

The other problem that still hasn't been resolved are the characters. Burnham remains completely unlikable but in different ways now... she's so fucking selfish its absolutely painful to watch. She truly believes she's the centre of the universe. The rest of the characters are simple and not fleshed out, and when they have character development it happens so quickly as to seen irrational and like a total 180. 

Its poorly written. Moreover, the overall direction and premise as been a rapprochement to star wars style, which sickens me. Lower decks is the only of the new shows that has so far been meritable imo. Picard was buoyed by returns from favorites and good acting, but suffers the same problems with storyline and ridiculous, non relatable or approachable characters.

Unfortunately, the translations of Adira's coming out as non-binary are mostly less than stellar.

In Polish, Adira says something like (""nigdy nie identyfikowałam się jako kobieta, więc wolę 'oni'"") ""I never identified as a woman, and so I prefer 'they'"" (as in, the Polish plural pronoun, which btw is also gendered) but in Polish changing just the pronoun or even just the third person verbs to agree with the pronoun (like they do in the later scene, using plurals) is not enough! While some Polish non-binary people use the plural (although it's mostly a calque from English), they also need to do it in the first person (especially in the past tense), since otherwise verbs like ""identified"" are also gendered. Here's an overview of how it works in Polish: [https://zaimki.pl/english](https://zaimki.pl/english)

In Latin American Spanish it's even worse! It's ""nunca me he sentido como una persona, entonces prefiero 'ellos'"", which means ""I never identified as one person, so I prefer 'they'"". The translator completely misunderstood it (probably based on their Trill memories) and thought that ""they"" here refers to them feeling as a plural entity instead of just one person.

Out of the languages I've checked, only the translator to Spain Spanish actually used non-binary pronouns used by Spanish people (""elle"") instead of, at best, using a calque of ""they"" as a plural form that isn't actually used much in a given language.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,269349,public,self,Adira – disappointing translations,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k6h1mf/adira_disappointing_translations/,all_ads,6,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'A5KSmv7iEYSqOz7GMj8gh8gvVpPQn5RZWFi9dpHAzcA', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0Ss1SdSZqBS7ddKy6yu5vsN1PY2hTMIRUJvooCbc4Js.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e25e01ab55deada4db3aa6a0604fb619e8066f32', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0Ss1SdSZqBS7ddKy6yu5vsN1PY2hTMIRUJvooCbc4Js.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e8c3161e2f7e002d08c7eb36d532b8e31000cb8', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0Ss1SdSZqBS7ddKy6yu5vsN1PY2hTMIRUJvooCbc4Js.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3e0a46efb4b5b6e441d0a4c19c86d9c24ee370', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0Ss1SdSZqBS7ddKy6yu5vsN1PY2hTMIRUJvooCbc4Js.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7dd924a392eca236a8821debf2ec1186626df4', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0Ss1SdSZqBS7ddKy6yu5vsN1PY2hTMIRUJvooCbc4Js.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e8fed70346b2f73a85744f54f2ee7bae71cf7b7', 'width': 960}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0Ss1SdSZqBS7ddKy6yu5vsN1PY2hTMIRUJvooCbc4Js.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fac1bb67aee39f672f375028c40f0ee406cc4fb', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 600, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/0Ss1SdSZqBS7ddKy6yu5vsN1PY2hTMIRUJvooCbc4Js.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5ae12d20e0e421a4364e56f62cd572e061dbb869', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m now watching “The Chase.” And after all the times I’ve watched this episode, and I’m old enough to have watched it when it first aired, I still love this episode.

-	Norman Lloyd: I mean, to see him with Patrick Stewart is such a treat.
-	John Cothran, Jr.: such a fun-spirited Klingon. His scenes with Data are TNG comedy done well (not something done that often).
-	Linda Thorson: perhaps it’s a recipe for biscuits. Seeing Cardassians in TNG interwoven with DS9 really helps cement DS9 as part of the Star Trek universe (and of course it is, but it’s nice to see them this way.
-	“Perhaps…one day”: the whole story of humanoids DNA carrying a message for eons is such classic Star Trek. Crisscrossing the galaxy, battling Cardassians and Romulans while trying to piece together a puzzle as old as life itself while maintaining humor throughout is everything ST V wanted to be…but wasn’t.

And permit an older fan to wax nostalgic. Back in the before the Internet was really a thing days, there was a fan theory of “The Providers,” which I can’t remember if they were associated with the Triskelions or not…it’s been a while. But the fan theory was that they were the first humanoid life and they scattered their seed across the galaxy, and many of the humanoid life we see in the 23rd century (TOS days) were from them. That explained why so many aliens looked roughly human-like. I mean, costume and makeup budgets and technology being what it was in the 60s and 70s.

So to see Salome Jens as this first of the humanoid life felt like a fan theory confirmed back in 1993.

Also, Salome Jens also made my watch of DS9 confusing. DS9 premiered as I was graduating college, and I wasn’t able to give it the same viewing on tv as I had TNG. Recognizing her as the Changling as well as the proto-humanoid life, I went many, many years thinking that Changlings were the proto-humanoids.

___

**Episode 37 - ""The Sanctuary""**

* There is an episode of DS9 called ""Sanctuary,"" though it has no resemblance whatsoever to this installment.
* The subplot of the episode revolves around Saru choosing a command catchphrase; Carol Freeman faced a similar dilemma in ""Envoys.""
* Michael warns against Book's ship surviving ""transwarp."" Transwarp has had multiple meanings over the years, from *Excelsior's* experimental propulsion system to the Borg's preferred method of travel to the new invention in ""Threshold."" Generally speaking, it is the ""next step up"" from regular warp drive.
* Emerald Chain's MO seems to be roaming the galaxy solving problems at steep prices. The eponymous gang in ""Think Tank"" had a similar role.
* We get a slightly better look at the map in Vance's office, and the previously-seen ""Klingon Zone"" includes the homeworld of Qo'noS.
* Osyraa fiddles with a combadge from the PIC era.
* Osyraa's lair is filled with scrap, and at 6:10 there is a passing shot of a console with a round central display and a joystick. Although it seems to be connected to some kind of dilithium End Portal, I would not be surprised if it was a callback of some kind, but I would have no idea where it would be from.
* Tolor is tossed into a room with a giant ravenous creature, a staple of the franchise. Well, not *this* franchise...
* The hidden signal is an SOS hidden under a melody. In ""Menage a Troi"" Riker took background noise and hid an SOS in the form of a melody. Additionally, the last time a crew found a distorted song being broadcast was in *The Voyage Home.*
* Detmer is here established as something of a hotshot pilot, evoking Tom Paris, who would take the *Delta Flyer* out for side missions and joyrides.
* Osyraa's ship is called the *Viridian;* the Veridian system is where the *Enteprrise-D* was destroyed.",True,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,269235,public,spoiler,"Canon References - ""The Sanctuary"" [Spoilers]",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k5wwoc/canon_references_the_sanctuary_spoilers/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My fave Star Trek shows are in order:
Disco, tng, voy, tos, ent, ds9, Picard 

I thought Picard was terrible - almost gave up halfway through the season - forced myself to finish it - got better but still overall weak - story arc was not interesting - acting was forced - sets looked cheap - production value just seemed very b movie ish
Discovery one the other hand for me is the total opposite - everything I’ve ever wanted in a Star Trek show - it delivers on depth in characters, versatility in the story, literally going places noones has been before, each season has had great leads and supporting cast, michael burnam is fantastic - headstrong, dynamic, emotional, leads from the front, real nice the way they have centred the show on someone who isn’t the captain - love the bravery - most importantly I love the actual sci fi in the show - the multiverse, the spore drive, the tech in the 32nd century, I love how they explored spocks youth, georgiou should get an award for best supporting actress - another great addition to the best sci fi show on tv since .....

Mild spoilers below. (The title is tongue-in-cheek but I couldn’t resist.)

&gt;!I’m really glad to finally see a non-binary character, and I really like their portrayal overall, especially in episode 3x4 “Forget Me Not”, which is one of my favorite of the series, and perhaps of Star Trek generally. How they handled them coming out to Stamets, however, feels a bit anachronistic (in the sense of being out of *the crew’s* time, not out of our own time). It wasn’t necessary to have a big coming out scene and then a later scene where Stamets and Hugh use their pronouns about 15 times in the course of a few sentences just to drive it home. I get the significance, and I get that Star Trek has always been a way to tell stories about contemporary humanity, but when it comes to matters of race, gender, and sexuality, it’s generally done so best when it’s shown what a more inclusive world looks like, rather than projecting our current inadequacies into the future. Adira should just be a non-binary character like Stamets and Hugh are gay, Uhura is a black woman, etc., and everyone should know, and we should periodically see how that affects them, etc., but it shouldn’t be a Big Deal.

In an episode of the Babysitter’s Club earlier this year, there was a transgender character, and it *was* a big deal to her, and there was a scene in which someone had to be dressed-down for not referring to her properly. That was appropriate, because it took place in the 21st century! I’d hope by the 32nd century we’d be well past the need for that.!&lt;",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,269220,public,self,Battle of the Non-Binary Star,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k5uylj/battle_of_the_nonbinary_star/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stay with me here:

- Cue the USS Discovery, jumping from place to place as usual.

- Upon arrival after some random, long distance jump, Discovery's sonar beeps with unknown contacts.  On one of those contacts is a starfleet officer, Ensign Ro (Michelle Forbes).

-Immediately, Discovery beams her aboard from a ship marked *""Pegasus""*.  She arrives on the transporter pad standing in silent shock, with welling tears, at the exact moment Caprica Six has a pistol aimed at her face.  Discovery then makes a clean get away.

Ensign Ro is back in the federation fleet from being stranded undercover in the Colonial Fleet as Admiral Cain.  Clearly she's aged.  Wiser, a Razor.

Ro deserves to be written off in such a great way.  Michelle Forbes was a great actress in both shows and is basically the same badass anyway.

It would be unbelievably unlikely that hundreds or thousands of years after diverging that any of the same people exist in both universes given the differences between terrans and humans. People would choose partners differently or die before reproducing or any number of other factors would lead to entirely different sets of people in both universes.

However, in all the mirror universe episodes across the franchise everyone always has a counterpart.

Obviously the real answer is that it is a convenient plot device, but this must imply some kind of metaphysical reason that explains it in universe. Does the universe require balance on an individual level? What about the ships that are carbon copies of each other with different paint jobs? Even crews can remain largely the same between them. The implications of any reason for this could be very profound if explored.

So I'm relatively new to the show (introduced through Discovery &amp; Picard, working my way through Next Generation currently) so feel free to make me aware of inaccuracies, but these two schools of thought genuinely fascinate me, not so much for their differences, but for their similarities.

If I understand it correctly:

* Vulcan philosophy seeks purely the path of logic in order to find and express the ultimate truth.
* The Qowat Milat's Way of Absolute Candour seeks purely emotional transparency to find and express the ultimate truth.

Despite the opposing method of revealing the truth, the essence of their intent is the same and the self-discipline (meditation, training, etc) required to achieve these extremities is also very similar.

To combine them, so that is to be both emotionally honest AND logically sound-minded, would be a very powerful philosophy to maintain. Knowing you are speaking truthfully about your emotions implies you are distinctly aware of what those emotions are. Awareness of their existence allows you to better understand their source and nature. To then temper but not repress these emotions based on their source but as an onlooker through a locus of logic would result in an answer that is both emotionally aware and logically sound. 

This would likely achieve more in a socially diverse society (like Ni'Var) that requires solutions to a range of viewpoints than it ever would in a homogenous society like on (old) Vulcan.

Perhaps this would be the ultimate philosophical understanding Burnham needs to come to in Discovery in order to properly find her place again, not only in Starfleet, but also as a member of Vulcan and Human society. Her conclusion to withdraw her request in the latest episode could point towards this development!

Are there any examples of Vulcans or Romulans like this in canon?

In TOS, Spock was the science officer. He was also the first officer, but really, most of the time, to anyone watching, he was a science officer. His uniform was science-blue, not command-gold. Sure he'd sit in the captain's chair when Kirk was away, but aside from that, he didn't have any big first-officer-duties as far as I can recall.

In TNG, however, Riker was the full-time first officer, without any other role. The Enterprise D is a heck of a lot bigger, so it makes sense they might need more management-type positions to organize the crew.

With Discovery, we're back to a small crew, so I wonder if the formal position of first officer is necessary.

I grew up watching TNG with my dad. I've watched every episode of every show multiple times -- even Enterprise, which I thoroughly enjoyed despite the general consesus that it wasn't all that good. In Discovery's first two seasons I had the same problems as everyone else, mostly around how the show seemed to trample all over established canon. But despite this, I more-or-less enjoyed the first two seasons. But I find myself unable to stomach the third season. I'll jump right into the reason why:  


In Season 3, being 900-years out of place has forced the crew to come together as a family. This is a character-building element that a lot of fans wish Voyager had had more of. But with Voyager, the Maquis / Starfleet angle got resolved much too soon, everyone but B'Elanna seemed completely resigned to the realities of their lifelong journey almost immediately, and it's as if Janeway's decision to continue running the ship as if it were still a Starfleet vessel in the Alpha Quadrant curtailed either the writers' desire or ability to portray Voyager as a nascent family rather than a crew of colleagues. Discovery won't make the same mistake: a crew stranded among strangers naturally becomes a family. OK, good. But we know \*nothing\* about over half the regulars on the show. And for me, that completely undermines the overarching story they're trying to tell.  


In Season 3, the bridge crew aren't individuals; they're a singular character -- the bridge officers -- that get brought out for, honestly, cringy, campy scenes like reminiscing under the tree at Starfleet Academy, or sharing a meal with Saru, or smiling and going 'ah cool!' as they get new badges, or one-by-one telling Tilly to ''just say yes,'' despite the fact that she may be the most unqualified commanding officer that we've ever seen (it would be like Janeway giving Harry Kim the position as First Officer over Chakotay or Tuvoc, but if Harry Kim had no self-confidence or leadership qualities whatsoever). But why did Tilly get the nod? Well, who else could have?! Who is Rhys? Who is Bryce? Who is Owosekun (I had to look up her name because I forgot)? Who is the blonde woman whose name I literally don't even know despite the fact that she's in every scene with the bridge crew? What do we know about Detmer besides the fact that she has PTSD from flying the ship through the wormhole?   


The bridge crew are basically extras. They show up once in awhile, smile, clap, give each other hugs, and then we get back to the Michael Burnham show. And I didn't mind it being the Michael Burnham show during seasons 1 and 2. Sure, it bothered me that the bridge crew were an irrelevant afterthought without backgrounds, whose names I couldn't even remember most of the time, but it wasn't detrimental to the overarching narrative. In Season 3, however, the writers are trying to tell me that these clearly irrelevant afterthoughts that they've put zero effort into fleshing out are actually characters with depth; a family that I should care about. When Commander Nhan decided to stay behind, I thought ''OK, who cares?'' The only things I knew about her were things I had learned 5 minutes prior, in that very same episode. But her decision to stay was supposed to carry weight -- we're losing a 'member of the crew.' And imagine, we knew more about her than any of the bridge crew and she \*wasn't even part of the Discovery crew.\*  


And that's the problem for me: there is no crew. There's Michael Burnham, there's Saru (only from the halfway point of Season 2; prior to that were \~20 episodes with a First Officer we knew hardly anything about), and to a lesser extent there are Stamets, Tilly, and Georgiou. But the 'family' that Discovery insists exists is a farce. And the insistance that it isn't only makes me want to know more about the bridge crew -- to understand them as individuals, to fall in love with them like I have the crews of the various Enterprises, DS9, and Voyager. And I keep expecting the show to develop the bridge crew's characters. But it never does. And so, for me, Season 3 took the fact that the bridge crew are clearly an afterthought from 'annoying' to 'inexcusable'. I don't know that I can watch another 7 or 8 episodes in which Rhys smiling or Detmer being stressed is considered character development.  


Am I wrong? I love Star Trek so much. And I want so badly to love Discovery, too. It wasn't so hard when all I had to do was pretend that the Spore Drive somehow fit with canon, or pretend that the new Klingons didn't look a bit silly; but now the show's asking me to pretend that its invested in characters who may as well be nameless. And yet, I see online that the general consensus among fans is that Season 3 is incredible. What am I missing?

I’m about 2 seasons into DS9, after watching TNG a solid 3 times, Enterprise, the full 1-10 movies multiple times in sequence, and TOS. 

They’re all clearly distinctively different and unique, and that’s very much art. I just hope for something to come for DS9. 

DS9 is a neglected child. TNG has most seasons in 1080p with remastered models and updated effects and film, same with TOS. I really do think that TOS has  significant improvements with the remasters (especially in retrospect when you compare Disney and Star Wars getting so many modifications from the original theatrical release etc) 

Who do we need to contact from CBS to get remastered DS9. They must have original film or digital archives! The effects are all something around 480p!?!? This franchise deserves better. 

All I’m saying is, put in the ***legitimate*** effort, I’m one of countless others they will buy a copy of blu-ray DS9 with remastered effects, audio, picture etc. it’s a disgrace that the primary source is Netflix with at best 480p to 1080p upscales.

So once again that song touches me as I imagine the joy of those families being able to make video calls for the first time with friends and relatives during this pandemic. Their kids being able to finally actually have a usable connection to attend class remotely.. etc.. 

For many of us there's always a long road that we've travelled.. and ENT was the show that made that clear for me.. all the others had their own roads to travel too.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,269045,public,self,Star Trek: Enterprise and Intro Song,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k53n9a/star_trek_enterprise_and_intro_song/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm sure there's other captains I'm forgetting.

Does anyone with naval (commercial or military) experience/knowledge know if any real world captain's have a similar order they use, or even just use the Star Trek lines?  Obviously, naval ships don't have an equivalent to warp drive so there isn't a burst of speed to punctuate the order.

Beyond the laws against genetic modification, isnt it highly unethical to create children in a lab and raise them like guinea pigs purely for observation?

The Federation is portrayed as a paradise where all problems have been solved, yet in spite of their supposed enlightenment, future humans struggle to appreciate cultures that are too unlike their own. Aside from Dax, who among the crew respects Ferengi culture? It's a bit close minded to regard them as being culturally primitive when their history is free of large scale wars and other blights humanity not only suffered but came close to destroying themselves with.

Enter the Watti. Sisko is not only completely put off by their lack of interest in Star Fleet first contact protocols, he apparently spent several hours at Quark's bar watching them play games without ever once trying to engage them on that level. He even refers to their game playing as ""childish"" when he speaks to Jake later. While being stuck inside of a game with no idea of what is in store for you might be scary, even after he sees everyone is fine after the game is over, Sisko still tears into the Watti representative. It's hardly a wonder we never see them again.

Move Along Home might be one of the clearest examples of the Federation's hypocrisy in DS9. They want to encounter new life and new civilizations...just as long as they aren't *too* new. The Bajorans need more aid? Well, they'll just have to become more like us and join up! What's that, the Cardassians are breaking another treaty and behaving savagely? Oh well! We need to appease them and send them more industrial replicators than we gave the Bajorans (because Sisko being the Emissary means we've got them in the bag, right?) because we want them to be part of the Federation too (never mind that making no sense at all).

Relative to a human, Andorian, or Klingon child, how OLD would a Vulcan child be in the Federations equivalent of elementary, middle, or high-school?

Current Theory: Vulcan's Mature at the same rate as Humans until they finish the second-stage of Puberty at 20-30. 

Yes, Vulcan's live longer than Humans, but they also exist on a Hell-World where most non-plant species can't afford to wait 20 years for a child to develop enough to survive alone in the wilds if mom dies to a predator. Nor can society wait 30 years for a Farmer to grow up from a hungry, horny gremlin into a competent worker. Basically, the same pressures that forced Vulcans to evolve stronger and smarter than Humans, also includes a truly TERRIBLE puberty that forces them to develop along the same time-tables as Humans until adult-hood where their biology begins to slow-down.

Like probably so many others, I've been using a large chunk of this covid lockdown time to get caught up on tv that I've been meaning to watch for years, and I've FINALLY started on Star Trek. And do you ever get that feeling that something is just kind of FOR YOU, and it has been all along, even if you haven't known it, but now that you're here you're home?

That's how I feel about Star Trek. I sort of always knew that I would like it, but I wasn't prepared for just how much it would resonate with me. Particularly TNG. I watched TOS and enjoyed quite a lot of it, but TNG is like....MY SHOW. I'm a completist and would never even consider skipping episodes XD so I've watched it all, and I even love the first two seasons, despite their often hot-mess-itude! To me, they are fun on their own for what they are and  just make the shift  to greatness in the later seasons even more enjoyable! Of course, as someone who wasn't even born when the show started airing and can now just Netflix it, it's probably easier to forgive when you know you can just keep watching until it gets better. 

It's probably easier for me to forgive a lot of things! For example, I don't totally hate Wesley! Sure he's a big ol Mary Sue a lot of the time, but for the most part I find him pretty adorable! For some reason, every episode featuring Barclay feels like fanfiction to me, but it's cool! Lwaxana Troi is an angel and brings some much-needed fashion moments to the show! All the opinions about Q being the best are 100 percent correct! 

I'm jealous of people who got to experience the show in real time. I can't even imagine how I would have reacted at the end of Best of Both Worlds Part 1 back when it first aired. I, a 25 year old woman in 2020, was literally screaming in my apartment as that amazing music cue faded and had to immediately call my Star Trek-loving Uncle to scream over the phone to him, but was able to watch the next part right after. Had I been a kid watching this show back in the day, I think I would have lost my mind.

Anyway, this is all just to say thank you to this community, because I've enjoyed coming here after watching episodes and searching for discussions to see what people had to say, even though I've never participated. It has definitely added a nice dimension to my journey into the world of Star Trek, which I don't intend to stop anytime soon! I am a bit worried that I'll never love anything as much as I love TNG (I just love it so much, help!) but I fully intend to watch it all. I feel like I've entered a new era of my life and everything previous was Before Trek, and now I've entered my After Trek era......too dramatic?!

Even nowadays, with gender affairs being openly debated, I found the episode provocative and well-written, despite the cruelty in the last scenes. Can you imagine this on TV in 1992?   


As season 5 became more popular every day, many critics raise questions concerning the way the episode depicts an allegory for sexual identity. One issue is that Soren identifying herself as a female was not mandatory in the story.  In any case, I am trying to look at this episode from another perspective. What struck me the most is how intense the Will-Soren relationship becomes, and this dialogue between Will and Deanna:

\---

W: I met someone - someone who has become important to me. 

D: Soren.

W: Yes. You're my friend I thought... I don't know, I thought I should tell you.

D: I'm glad you did.

W: Nothing will change between us, will it? 

D: Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing. But we'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life, and I'm part of yours. That much will always be true.

Will smiles and kisses her.   
\---  


IMO the message here is that we, as human beings, are mutable. We keep changing the way we identify ourselves, our sexuality, the way we perceive others.  Therefore, our relationships must be as dynamic as we are. Despite all the controversy of the ""conversion therapy"" at the end of the episode, I considered this episode completely underrated.

Wspecially extended space flight. Beside artificial gravity and other things they didn't cheap out on how space flight would be achieved. I was watching TNG where the get caught in a interstellar boobie trap. They get caught in some form of radiation. Somehow it causes their shields to begin decaying. Dr. Crusher mentions how once the shield goes down the radiation will effect the crew and passengers. All hands will die after 30 minutes of exposure. 

Although it isnt stated you can imagine the Shields were not initially designed for protecting the ships from attack, but more likely interstellar radiation. Its a real issue with space flight today, we may not be able to withstand the radiation. Once we travel outside the atmosphere nothing is really protecting us anymore. We get hot with so much UV radiation that our cells die off. That is why we are researching so that when we leave it can be for longer than a trip to the moon. Of course I dont think the ISS is so far outside the farthest layers of our atmosphere that it matter a huge amount.

Sorry for the tangent,  it I love how Star Trek isn't like Star Wars. You can't just do whatever you want. It still exists in our world of physics and consequence. I appreciate the extent the writers went to to keep the show as practical as possible. Especially the original series which came out before we went to tge moon.

At this point humans are supposed to be scientifically and emotionally woke! I get that they’re 900 years into the future and away from all they know and love and feel really emotional, but they tend to cry over every little matter. 

Instance 1: When Michael Burnham gets demoted from First Officer after knowingly disobeying the captains order to go and rescue Book. Why does she have to cry? She should’ve known the consequences for her actions will have an effect on the image the crew is trying to from with the new federation. 

Instance 2: When Tilly gets assigned as the Acting First Officer, why does she need to cry and hug Michael and make that a whole emotional moment? Not denying that she had to face Michael regarding the whole “I’m taking your post” thing, but crying all the time makes them seem so compromised and vulnerable, when it should be the exact opposite?

The second one seems a bit weak and there’s been multiple instance of such unprofessionalism from the crew that I have observed. I am not saying that there shouldn’t be a portrait of emotions, because that would just seem lame and inhuman. But can we reel it in with the scenes where crying shouldn’t really be a thing from the level of professionalism that is meant to be portrayed.

I liked Tasha fine.  She was no better or worse than any of the other bland characterizations of secondary characters in the 1st season.  But the show was really crowded.  Too many actors to get pushed to the side, and with Tasha gone, you had Worf take his rightful place heading security.

Think about the original Trek: You had two leads (Kirk and Spock), two secondaries, McCoy and Scott, and then 3 or 4 recurring background characters that may or may not get much dialogue at all (Sulu, Uhura and Rand for the 1st season, Chekov the 2nd).  That's only 7, with most of them more background than anything else.  (Note: Yes, i know one could argue that McCoy was a lead.)

But with TNG, they switched to more of an ensemble cast, with 1 lead and 8 secondaries which all had more screen time than than their counterparts on TOS.  That makes for a very bloated cast in story-telling.  I'm not a Wesley hater, but for the simple reason of space, he should have never been a cast member either.  If anything, i would have rather seen Tasha at the helm, and dump Troi entirely, as she was not necessary to the crew.

In any case, whichever characters are your least favorites, actor bloat meant someone had to go.

There is no reason to believe it would change anything in the short term, is it? Discussing it with other people, however, it seems some are under the impression that solving it is would possibly (or probably) restore warp travel.

I researched it to the best of my abilities, but I think we're short on details. So a few questions, just to make sure I'm not missing anything:

1) Why is warp travel gone?

To my understanding, the only thing stopping it is the lack of dilithium. Supply was already dwindling before, and I think it's implied that recrystallization isn't possible on a mass scale, maybe because burned dilithium is useless, so all they have left are the small quantities that survived for whatever reason. Fear that dilithium would explode again could stop some people from using it, but it wouldn't stop the whole galaxy.

2) Is there any reason to believe finding who or what caused The Burn will bring warp back in the short term?

Of course, it's TV, so it's possible that everything will be neatly solved in the end, and IDK, maybe the bad guys behind The Burn know how to fix burned dilithium or have been using alternative tech in secret this whole time. But is there any reason for Michael to believe that learning what happened will fix anything immediately? Because my impression is that she has this vague notion that if there's a threat behind it all the Federation will never be able to safely rebuild, which makes sense but hardly justifies lying and almost quitting Starfleet not to delay the search for a week or two. A good idea I just learned from another redditor is that if Michael proves The Burn was not caused by SB-19 the Vulcans/Romulans could get back to developing an alternative, but that doesn't seem to be Michael's plan at all (and even then, it'd be hard to buy that every single person with access to that information, and Vulcans no less, would stop studying the galaxy's only hope, something that could fix everything in a year, if it there weren't credible concerns).

So, is there any way to explain the whole The Burn drama except that Michael's unreasonably obsessed with it?",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,268908,public,self,What details do we have on warp drive and dillithium on current Discovery?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k4az7p/what_details_do_we_have_on_warp_drive_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2020, we started off with the final episode of *Short Treks* in 'Children of Mars', we then go into a 10 episode season of *Picard* and then a 10 episode season of *Lower Decks*, and now a 13 episode season of *Discovery* to take us into the new year. So as good as we've had it this year with content, there is a large elephant in the room. There has been little to no live action production this year. Start dates for Picard, Section 31, Strange New Worlds have all been thrown out the window, with only Disco S4 recently beginning. Animated Trek has managed to survive these delays for the most part, and is going full steam ahead

So it looks like 2021 is going to be a more vacant one. But what could we see next?

Well Lower Decks has a second season being produced side by side with the first, so that is the next candidate for release, sometime earlier in the year probably. 

We then will likely go into Star Trek Prodigy's first season on Nickelodeon in the middle of the year

And that could very well be it. The live action shows have a 1 year turnaround, and as most of them are set to start shooting next year, we can't expect PIC S2, SNW S1, S31 S1 to be out until 2022 at the earliest. The only other thing we could see in 2021 is Disco S4 beginning to air sometime in December, but that seems like it would almost certainly fall back to 2022 also. And lord knows what's up with Short Treks, for such an acclaimed series with such use, you'd think they would have announced something from it besides ""It'd be interesting to do more""

So I'm watching DS9 for the first time since a few weeks and when I saw ""Looking for par'Mach in all the Wrong Places"" yesterday I noticed that the acting was somehow different. It's a little difficult to explain, but it seemed like all the actors were on a whole new level of liveliness and motivation. Be it Odo joking about Kira's relationship with O'Brien, Dax while teaching Quark how to use a bath'leth or Bashir while having a fun little chat with O'Brien - something just felt nrw about the way they portrayed their feelings. 

After being a little confused at first, I quickly began to love this ""new"" style of acting. Don't get me wrong - I loved all of the characters the way they were before, and they don't act completely new in this episode, but it feels like they have... expanded their character traits to make them even better suited as before. And there couldn't have been a better episode than this one to experiment with this new acting style.

Did anyone feel the same about this episode when they first saw it, or is it just me? And what do you think could be the reason for this rather interesting ""change""?

He did not write ""The Gamesters of Triskelion"" nor ""Arena"", but these episodes got similar story tropes.

But, Star Trek has always been a part of my life. It shaped my morals, it helped to instill into me the values that all life is sacred, to never judge by appearances, that knowledge and strength are useless if not destructive if you've not the respect or discipline to wield them. That what can seem to be a bloodthirsty enemy could just be someone scared, lashing out, and they just need a proper avenue to understand and learn. That protecting the masses means ensuring the smallest of us have all of their rights and dignities intact.

My perfect future would be one akin to what the Federation has accomplished. I truly feel the era of a United Earth is closer now than ever before, but we must take measures to ensure our equality and fairness. I shudder to think of a world where the Replicator has become a commonplace item, but for greedy purposes it is restricted (Think about how Electric Cars have all but been shot in the kneecap because Oil Companies need their profits). I base my political decisions and votes on a simple metric: ""Will this help to push us down the path of Star Trek's future?"" 

I don't think Star Trek is some magical gospel, but I do feel that people pick up their morals from the content they have absorbed over their lifetime (be it sports, human interactions, or television/videogames/books). In the end it is not necessarily the work itself but rather what you get out of that work. Harry Potter for example is a series undergoing a critical self-look by the fandom, finding many troublesome things within the work (House Elves being ""happy slaves"" just does not sit well for many) but it is indisputable that many people were able to form their morals from the series, morals such as: Friendship is worth more than power, Love is a stronger force than anyone knows, it is better to die protecting someone than to live only for yourself. 

And that's what I keep coming back to. Yeah, there are a lot of wacky adventures and somethings that, despite apparently happening 500 years from now, are downright dated. But again and again I find myself looking at this fictional universe and thinking ""How can we bring ourselves to be closer to that?""

Remember those transporters in ""Star Trek Picard""? The ones at Starfleet headquarters, where you can simply walk through and then materialize somewhere else. Combine the distance of the Khan transporter and those ""walk-in transporters"", and you have stargates. No need for warp anymore. Just walk to another planet in another quadrant, daisy chain those transport hubs and you can go anywhere in the galaxy by walking 100 meters...

The Federation can then live on and expand. Especially since personal transporters are a thing, probably for short range, but that means that the energy efficiency of transporters is super high in the 32nd century. So maybe they can even build stargates for starships in orbit. Again, no need for warp anymore.

The few ships with warp can then position the stargates in orbit of member planets and rebuild the Federation.

What's interesting is that I can say that this is a totally ""CW"" show. Even Enterprise was more ""Berman"" than this. This is weirdly, totally ""CW"".

I've seen all of TNG and DS9 and as a pair they are core Trek. DS9 is, at its peak, Peak Trek. I never saw season 3, but I've watch 1&amp;2 and a few episodes of ""4"" (TAS) and all of ""5"" (STC) of TOS. 

I consider the TOS films to be core, the TNG films to be in that realm of ""meh, okay, lame, but meh"" category of 90s films which the Brosnan Bonds occupy.

JJ Trek is alright, but very different. CBS Trek, all the way around, is garbage. For bad world building, bad plot, weird acting, awful writing, cheap sets.

But Voyager? Honestly, it went on so long, and is so very different. It ""looks"" like TNG/DS9 Trek. As I said, Enterprise had bits of its ""90s TV"" style, but Enterprise was more Berman-esque, mostly in the vein of the TNG films. The fourth season was very good and focused almost into the DS9 realm.

Voyager?

This IS, as I said, CW Trek.

But I love it.

It takes cheap, cheezy, pedestrian character drama that the other Treks in spite of themselves did NOT have, and elevates it. It takes ""CW"" and elevates it to a very respectful ""Star Trek"" level of style, lore and form. It therefore produces almost like an enlightened version of what you'd see in ""Xena Warrior Princess"". It's schlocky, but sincere, intellectual, and worships the legacy of Star Trek.

It's not DS9 or TNG. It's its own thing. But somehow it's just really great in its own way. It's proof that Trek can elevate things.

It proves why CBS Trek is so bad, because it belittles and lowers Trek (when Trek should automatically lift up genres, styles and properties).",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,268838,public,self,Praise To Voyager,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k3tmlp/praise_to_voyager/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But then I remembered an episode of TNG: Up The Long Ladder. As I recall (it's been a while since I've seen it), DNA is taken from Riker and Polaski without their permission to make clones.

Kind of. 

To be perfectly clear, I’ve seen my favorite episodes dozens of times each, and every episode at least once, but even with my favorite shows I don’t do a complete series overhaul very often. About three months ago I decided it was time to go through TNG as a whole once more. It reinvigorated my love of it all right. Oh, I’ve always remained steadfast in my love of it sure, but it can be another thing entirely to remain *passionate* after a certain amount of time away has elapsed. The biggest takeaways were how much two episodes in particular grew on me: The Defector and Frame of Mind. I think because on my first watch through as a teen I never quite liked the Romulan centric stories as much as Klingon or even Cardassian ones (“They’re just unreasonable Vulcans” I might have said), and an episode like Frame of Mind was too out there for me back then I think. But they rose quite a bit in my esteem this time around.

As a Trekkie who loves DIS I just wanted to list some things that DIS does well. 

**-The main cast are all incredible.** Yes the show is very much centered around SMG but she does an amazing job. Her speech in the latest episode easily rivals classic trek speeches. The rest of the cast is great too. Michel Yeoh steals every scene she's in. Her and Sonequa Martin-Green's scenes are always great. Doug Jones has vaulted into the pantheon of trek captains in only a handful of episodes. I love how Saru is Starfleet through and through while having a completly different style from any previous captain.   


\-**Every episode this season has been a banger.** Every one has been a classic \~30 min trek episode with the burn as an intriguing B plot. The seed vault and the Ni'Var episodes are easily top 50 trek episodes. Getting a deep dive in to barzan culture was refreshing given how many trek races are so one note. The misunderstood monster is a classic trek plot that was done really well. Watching that man suffer was legitimately heartbreaking. This latest episode was just a classic lawyer trek episode. It examined the consequence of a previous trek series without being overly fan servicy. 

**-the representation is awesome.** Its just awesome and is something trek should've done ages ago. 

\-**the ships and uniforms are awesome**. When I first watched discovery I hated the uniforms and the angular ships but now I really like them. The 31st century uniforms are similarly awesome and both compete with the TNG movies/lateDS9 uniforms for my favorite.

WTH? Do they have postal service that visits the ships? (I know, it's a rhetorical question) I wonder if the writers gave it a thought on how that would work, the Enterprise is in the middle of a mission, away from any base, that's what made me think.

Did anyone else's eyes roll back to their occipital lobe when after traveling 1000 years into the future, where everything we see should be new and amazing and imaginative, that like the 5th major character we meet is ... drumroll ... the main character's mom?

For me, this is one of those amazing ST gaffes, like 'brain and brain', Uhura's ST5 fan dance, or the horrible 'KHAN!!' yell in STID.  Not just a clunky moment but something that pulls me completely away from the show and makes me think, 'What the heck is going on?? What are they thinking?'  

I'm a fan from way back and root for Trek and want it to do well.  I've looked forward to new and interesting takes on ST when TNG and its successors were new, when JJ Trek was coming, and now CBS Trek.  But I can't shake the feeling that the creatives now in charge just don't know what they're doing, and don't have the imagination to tell new and interesting stories that scratch that ST itch.  The exception here is Lower Decks, which despite a bit of obnoxiousness at the start, has really developed into something with a lot of creativity and a unique voice.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

1. **Micheal Burnham and Cleveland Booker**

   A Black man (Booker) and Black woman (Burnham), and not one of the
   problems or challenges they face as people or as a couple is
   because they are Black.

   Just as important: there is no hint that their phenotypes could be
   the cause of a problem or challenge. (It doesn’t hurt that neither
   ‘Book’ nor Burnham have, so far, been saddled with any ‘Blackness
   as character marker’ tropes. At least so far as my not-American and
   English-is-not-my-first-languge head has spotted.)

   Want me to believe in a-little-bit-utopian imagined Star Trek
   future? This is absolutely one of the necessary things, for me.
   Because, without Black people (and not-White people in general)
   living as ‘just people’ being utterly normal, I’m not going to buy
   your imagined better future.

   Futures made up only of people who all look
   Northern-European–descended aren’t utopias, they are the aftermaths
   of genocide.

   Put another away, SF has to normalise Black people (and not-White
   people, more generally) living as unhyphenated humans. Black people
   not being defined as ‘African-American people’, or as ‘Black
   people’. Rather, they are ‘people’, living with the same
   opportunities, and the same constraints, and the same hopes, and
   the same fears, as every other person.

   This is not the same thing as so-called ‘colour-blind’ writing,
   which tends to turn everyone in to ‘generic White’.

   Differences don’t go away, they just stop acting as limitations, or
   barriers, or character markers.

   That latter point is a big one, BTW. ‘Sassy Black Woman’, for
   example, is not a character marker. It’s a racist trope that hides
   the trauma and exhausted and constant defence of self underlying
   the actual behaviours the trope appropriates.

2. **Adira Tal** and **Gray Tal**

   A woman (Adira) and a man (Gray) in a mixed-gender queer
   relationship, and the mixed-gender aspect isn’t used to argue the
   pair are ‘actually’ or ‘basically’ straight.

   Bisexual folk make up about 50% of all GSM folk. And about 80% of
   bisexual people are in mixed-gender relationships.

   My own, bisexual-centric, friends-and-family, circle, has a higher
   percentage of bisexual-folk in same-gender relationships than the
   world-wide average. But there are still multiple mixed-gender queer
   relationships in my circle. And their being mixed-gender doesn’t
   make them less queer.

   A *lot* of queer relationships are mixed-gender. But narratives
   that manage to acknowledge this, let alone actively show this, are
   not exactly common.

   So, even though this particular relationship is full of SFnal
   tropery (Gray isn’t human; and now he’s dead and only visible to
   Adira), I’ll take this one as a start. Better than nothing. Because
   nothing is, all-too-often, the only alternative on offer.

   It helps that both of them are cute as hell and manage to show
   ‘young love’ without being over-the-top with the adolescent drama
   (not because over-the-top adolescent drama is a bad thing, per se,
   but because it makes this particular representation all the more
   positive and delightful to watch).",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,268797,public,self,"Two relationships I particularly like in *Star Trek: Discovery*, season 3",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/k3lnc6/two_relationships_i_particularly_like_in_star/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I love, love, love DS9 as it was written and produced. These thoughts are not meant to disparage the show at all; it's simply musings about what else could have been.

Avery Brooks played a great Commander and Captain. The nuance he brought to the character was amazing.

I am well aware that Cmdr. Riker wanted the Enterprise. I also feel that, of all the characters on TNG, his character development was done the least-- not to say it wasn't done at all. But I think his character would have really blossomed on DS9. With that, we'll begin the musings:

# Riker's Charisma and Back-Alley Persona

For the developments that did happen with Cmdr. Riker, we got to see just slight glimpses of the wheeling-and-dealing that he could do. We also got to witness how intimidating he can get [on a few different occasions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEWKAVvH0QY) We've also seen how he had rapport with Quark. He's also shown how he can play dirty-- and this would have all been effective at DS9.

Cmdr. Sisko embodies a lot of those qualities, especially later on. And I think Cmdr. Riker being driven to some desperation would have been a great evolution of his character. I could absolutely see Riker truly losing it and saying, ""Major! Shut that thing off!"" as an example. Riker needing to tap into that side of his would have been instrumental during the Dominion War, and he would have had ample time to consider or regret what he was becoming.

# Getting Cmdr. Riker to relinquish the Enterprise via writing

As I had mentioned in the preface, Cmdr. Riker was adamant about having command of the Enterprise. It was a taste that was difficult to dismiss when he had command on a few occasions, particularly when they engaged the Borg. So the opening of Deep Space Nine would have needed to have the wormhole already recently discovered by the time the first episode lands, and the outpost seeking a capable commander. Enter William T. Riker.

# The Enticing Dynamics between Riker and the other DS9 characters

I think the only real dynamic that may be sacrificed in this scenario is the one between Jadzia and Benjamin. One of my favorite utterances throughout DS9 is the use of, ""old man."" Outside of that, I could absolutely see Riker and every character aboard DS9 having a great dynamic, and still be very similar to how Sisko's dynamics worked out. Many ideas pop into mind here.

# The Arrival of Worf

I could imagine how much the Trek fandom freaked out when Worf returned to Star Trek. I wasn't connected with them at the time, but seeing him appear made me scream out of excitement as a kid. I think the dynamic between Riker and Worf was already fantastic (""Besides... you look good in a dress.""). The further deepening of the dynamic would have been great for both of them.

I can think of many other points, but I'll save them from this already huge wall of text. I'll let you all ponder it, too.",True,False,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,268775,public,self,I wonder often about what would have happened if Cmdr.
