Original Airdate: 8 Sep, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5221.3. On outward course beyond the fringe of
our galaxy towards Questar M-17, a source of mysterious radio
emissions. Mission, starcharting.
 [Bridge]
 (The ship is at Red Alert) 
KIRK: Situation, Mister Scott? 
SCOTT: We've picked up speed, sir, rapidly. I've cut back power, but we
continue to gain momentum. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu? 
SULU: She's not answering the helm, sir. Two minutes right ascension
off course and drifting farther, Captain. 
KIRK: Stand by to reverse course. 
SULU: Standing by, sir. 
KIRK: Reverse course. 
SPOCK: I can only describe it as hypergravity, Captain, more powerful
than any we've ever encountered. It's dragging the Enterprise toward
it. 
KIRK: Why aren't our sensors picking it up? Forward scanners, Mister
Sulu. 
(The viewscreen shows a massive object) 
UHURA: Captain, that's the source of the radio emissions. 
SPOCK: Negative star mass. Spectra analysis, imploded matter, but every
reading on it is negative. 
SULU: Captain, we're still gaining speed. 
KIRK: Full reverse thrust. 
SULU: No good, sir. We're still falling toward it. 
KIRK: How much time do we have? 
SPOCK: Impact in ninety three seconds. Ninety two. Ninety one. 
UHURA: Captain, there's another signal. Listen. 
SPOCK: Forty seconds, Captain. Thirty nine, thirty eight. 
KIRK: Sulu, flank speed ahead. Our only chance is to try to get into
orbit around that thing. 
SULU: Aye, aye, Captain. 
SPOCK: Nine seconds. Eight, seven. Orbital velocity. 
KIRK: Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu. Maintain orbit. 
SULU: Aye, aye, Captain. 
MCCOY: If its pull is this strong, Jim, how do we get out of orbit? 
KIRK: Slingshot effect, Mister Spock? Do we have enough power? 
SPOCK: I'll need some time for the computations, Captain. 
UHURA: I'm getting that radio sound again, sir. Nine seconds right
ascension from galactic plane, dead ahead and closing fast. It's on the
viewscreen now, sir. 
KIRK: Put us alongside, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. 
(The object is made up of oval pieces connected by filaments. Very
alien and elegant) 
MCCOY: It's a starship like nothing I've ever seen. The size of it. 
KIRK: It's been damaged. I'll bet she was pulled in like we were. 
UHURA: It's coming from that ship, Captain. 
SPOCK: Confirmed, Captain, but it isn't possible. That ship is dead.
Temperature is absolute zero. There is no thermal reading to support
life aboard her, and no energy store to send radio messages. Nothing
except a slight magnetic flux reading which could be normal for the
ship's metal. 
KIRK: You're sure, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Probability point nine nine seven, Captain. 
KIRK: Can you identify that metal, or the design of the ship? 
SPOCK: Negative to both, Captain. Unknown alloy, harder and lighter
than any registered metal. It is not a recorded galactic starship
design. Retro analysis of the ship's spectra dates it as having been in
orbit here for slightly more than three hundred million years. 
UHURA: It's beautiful. What kind of people could have built it, to
touch even a starship with grace and beauty? 
KIRK: A civilisation that advanced three hundred million years ago
before life even emerged on Earth. 
MCCOY: Barely an instant in eternity, Jim. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, any indication of that ship's power source? 
SPOCK: No, Captain, but this far from a G1 star, it is logical to
assume they had some kind of warp drive. 
KIRK: We'll board her, Mister Spock. Scotty, Bones, you'll come with
us. We'll need life-support belts. Mister Sulu, have the Transporter
room stand by. 
SULU: Yes, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 KYLE: Ready, Captain. 
KIRK: Activate life-support belts. Energise.
 [Alien ship]
 (They arrive with their life-support glow around
them, on a huge filament linking two modules. It looks very organic) 
SPOCK: The hexagonal shape of the windows suggests a similarity to
natural insect designs of Earth, the honeycombs of bees. The individual
cells are shaped precisely like this. 
SCOTT: Would you look at this now? This metal, it isn't cast or rolled.
It was drawn into filaments and spun. 
KIRK: Like a spider spins his web. 
SPOCK: A lighter and stronger material than anything we have now. 
KIRK: Look, every pod, they've all been burst open. 
SCOTT: Aye, from the inside, from the looks of them. 
MCCOY: Must have been some accident to get almost every pod. 
SPOCK: Accidents seldom have such system, Doctor McCoy. I believe we
must consider the alternative possibility that the crew of this ship
destroyed her themselves.
 Captain's log. We have beamed aboard the alien
ship found orbiting a strange dead star. The Enterprise is recording
all data for the log and a full report later.
 [Alien ship]
 KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Enterprise. Lieutenant Uhura here.
 [Alien ship]
 KIRK: Lieutenant, are you still getting that radio
signal from this ship?
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Negative, Captain. It stopped transmitting
when you beamed aboard.
 [Alien ship]
 KIRK: All right. Lock on us with the transporter
and be ready to transport. We're going inside. 
UHURA [OC]: Transporter beam on and locked. Standing by.

 [Alien ship module]
 (They've found something that seems active) 
KIRK: What do you make of it, Spock? 
SPOCK: Captain, its registering energy. Very little, but building. 
KIRK: You mean it's functioning after all the milleniums this ship has
been here? 
SPOCK: The wands are accumulators, receptors to attract energy, motion,
sound, light, heat, every kind of energy around them. 
SCOTT: The structure of the ship, those huge arches, thrusting up. The
whole ship is designed to receive and store energy. 
MCCOY: Gives me the creeps. I feel like something's watching us. 
SCOTT: I feel it too, Captain. 
SPOCK: A physiological symptom of latent primal superstition, the fear
of primitive people confronting something unknown to them. 
KIRK: Compared to the beings that built this ship, we are primitive
people, even you, Mister Spock. All right, let's keep going. 
(They come to a hexagonal door. Spock fires his phaser at the control
and it opens. They walk down a hexagonal passageway into -)
 [Machine shop]
 (The door slams behind them and the machines wake
up) 
KIRK: Tricorder analysis, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Artificial gravity is in effect here, Captain. Both air and
gravity within two points of Earth normal. 
KIRK: Enterprise, do you read me? Sulu? 
SPOCK: No use, Captain. Some sort of interference has been set up. 
SCOTT: We can cut our way out of here. 
(But his phaser doesn't work) 
KIRK: No energy registering. Something's drained them. 
MCCOY: You mean we're trapped here? No communication, nothing? 
KIRK: For the moment. 
(They walk on) 
KIRK: This is, was, the control centre of the starship. These must be
control and navigational instruments. 
SPOCK: The source of the interference is here, Captain. It's not part
of the normal equipment. It's like something they jury-rigged during an
emergency. 
SCOTT: Something to shield this room. But shield it from what? 
SPOCK: Possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship. 
SCOTT: But nothing, no form of life could survive three hundred million
years. 
SPOCK: Quite right, Mister Scott. No known form of life. 
MCCOY: Jim, the door. 
(It is glowing around its edges) 
SPOCK: Something is trying to get in. The field of interference is
reacting against the magnetic flux lines, Captain. 
KIRK: Will it hold? 
SPOCK: If the energy stays at that level. 
(The control machine starts making a strange noise) 
MCCOY: What is it? 
KIRK: I'm not sure, but I think 
(A screen comes to life with a face on it) 
KIRK: It could be a ship's log or a warning. It seems to keep
repeating. 
MCCOY: A message from three hundred million years ago? 
SPOCK: It is possible that this much of their technology survived.
(fiddling with a panel) 
KIRK: Anything? 
SPOCK: I may be able to get a translation. 
MCCOY: Hurry up, Spock. 
SPOCK: Patience, Doctor. 
ALIEN [on screen]: Danger. Danger. The dead star, we are being drawn to
it. Rather than carry this malevolent life form to other worlds, we
have decided to destroy our own ship. There is no other answer. If you
understand this message, you are protected only for this moment in this
room. This thing it wants 
(Boom! Things blow up around them) 
KIRK: Get out of here! Hurry! 
(They are beamed away)
 [Transporter room]
 (Transporter Chief Kyle has a frightfully English
accent, and a mustache) 
KYLE: Located them right after that explosion, Mister Sulu. We're
locked on and beaming them aboard.
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Good work, Mister Kyle. I thought we lost
them when we were cut off so long.
 [Transporter room]
 KYLE: Piece of cake, sir. Here they come now. 
(Four figures and a green fog materialise) 
KYLE: Captain, something's beamed aboard with you. 
KIRK: Transport it back out. 
(But they are all attacked by the Green, then it gets into the
ventilation system, the doors and the control panels. Laughter comes
from the comm. panels on the walls)
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Status? 
UHURA: Sickbay reports no injuries to crew, sir. 
SCOTT: No damage to hull or engines, Captain. 
SPOCK: Automatic bridge defence system on and prepared, sir. 
KIRK: So, we're all just fine, but whatever was on that ship used our
transporter beam to come aboard with us, and now it's here. 
SCOTT: That alien commander, sir. The message said that they had to
destroy their own ship. 
KIRK: Until we learn more about it, Scotty, perhaps we should be ready
to do the same. Take two of your men and arm the self-destruct device
in the Engineering core. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir. 
(Scott leaves) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, any change in ship's readings? 
SPOCK: We're registering a slightly higher than normal magnetic flux.
Not dangerous, but the level isn't constant. It seems to fluctuate, a
steady, almost pulsing rhythm. 
KIRK: Like the beating of a heart. 
UHURA: Bridge, Lieutenant. What? Captain, decks five and six report
shutdown of all life-support systems. They've gone to life-support
belts, manual override is not responding. 
(Red Alert) 
SPOCK: Trouble in the Engineering core, sir. 
KIRK: Bridge to Sickbay.
 [Sickbay]
 KIRK [OC]: Bones, get down to the Engineering core
on the double.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Get on those life-support systems now.
 [Engineering]
 (Scotty, wearing a life-support belt, is trapped
by the cover of the core) 
MCCOY: The force field of his belt won't hold that weight for long,
Jim. 
KIRK: Override systems, Mister Spock. Open the core hatch. 
SCOTT: It's no use, sir. The mechanism is frozen. They've already
tried. 
SPOCK: Something's jammed the circuits. They're magnetised. 
KIRK: All right, get the cutter beams on that hatch. Move. 
ENGINEER: Yes, sir. 
(Finally they cut the hinge off the hatch and release Scott) 
SCOTT: I thank you, sir. 
SULU [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. Something's activating the ship's
phaser banks. They're locking on the alien starship. 
(The alien ship is destroyed)
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Phaser banks were off, Captain. They
activated themselves. 
KIRK: And mutual override did not work? 
SULU: No, sir. 
SPOCK: Exactly like the Engineering controls and the life-support
systems on decks five and six. 
(Scott and McCoy enter) 
SCOTT: Sir, we cannot get into the core. 
KIRK: The cutter beams. 
SCOTT: Drained of all energy, sir. 
UHURA: Sir, Cargo holds three, four and five just shut down
life-support systems. 
SPOCK: Power out on all but key levels, Captain. High magnetic flux
reading. 
UHURA: Captain Kirk, the ship's computers. Something's going through
every storage bank. It seems to be taking control of the whole ship. 
KIRK: Spock, can you rig a low-frequency shield like the one on the
alien ship, on our navigation console? 
SPOCK: It would have a very small field. 
KIRK: Do it. 
(A little later) 
SPOCK: It's activated, Captain, but only an area three metres square. 
KIRK: Do you get a magnetic flux reading there now? 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. 
MCCOY: Jim, you don't think that's going to help us? Whatever that
thing is, it survived millennia in a dead hulk. All it has to do is
outlast us and just take over. 
KIRK: No. It must be held by the magnetic force of the dead star, and
it needs a starship to break free and a crew to man it. 
GREEN: (speaking from the bridge defence system in the ceiling) You are
correct, Captain James T Kirk, and I have the starship I've waited for
so long, so terribly long. 
(The bridge monitors go crazy, then blank) 
SPOCK: It has absorbed the memory banks, Captain, all of them. 
GREEN: You will now remove the static shield from the navigation
console, Captain James T Kirk. 
KIRK: You have shut down life-support systems and endangered members of
my crew. Restore those systems first. 
GREEN: All nonessential systems are extinguished. You will obey me. 
KIRK: And if I refuse? 
(A beam is fired from the defence system at Kirk) 
GREEN: Obey me! 
SPOCK: Captain! 
(Spock is shot too) 
GREEN: Obey me! 
KIRK: Stop! You'll hurt him. 
GREEN: Remove the static shied from the warp drive controls! Do it now!

SPOCK: No, Captain. 
KIRK: I'll obey. Let him go. 
(The beam stops) 
(Kirk goes to the console, presses a button and puts his life-support
belt on it. The green alien is unhappy) 
GREEN: Repair the warp drive controls. Obey me! 
KIRK: Mister Scott, start repairs. Install the auxiliary controls. 
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. 
SPOCK: I'm all right, Captain. 
KIRK: What are we dealing with, Spock? 
SPOCK: High rank probabilities, Captain. It is a magnetic organism
without mass, but capable of symbiotic relationship with a host body, a
starship for instance. It is a form of primal energy, and it can
utilise the electronic control systems of a starship like the mind of a
man uses the neural control systems of the human body. It has become
the Enterprise, and we are only life-support organisms in its body like
the white corpuscles in human blood. And Captain, the magnetic flux
readings are higher. It is growing stronger, building itself. 
KIRK: A slingshot effect to yank us out of orbit. Can you compute it in
your mind? If we try to use ship's computers 
SPOCK: The alien will know. I believe I can, Captain. I will need to
aid Mister Scott. 
KIRK: The engineer will need aid from my first officer to complete
repairs. Is that permitted? (silence) I guess it is. 
GREEN: You will leave this orbit and plot course to galactic
coordinates zero three six point two three one. 
SULU: That's the heart of the galaxy, Captain. 
KIRK: Plot the course, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Captain, this symbiont can reproduce itself by mitosis and take
over every starship we encounter. It can control computer centres,
whole planets. 
KIRK: I'm aware of that, Mister Spock. 
GREEN: Complete repairs! Obey me! 
SCOTT: Auxiliary controls ready to activate, Captain. 
KIRK: The auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually. 
GREEN: That is correct. You will activate the manual controls. Obey! 
KIRK: Controls activated. 
SULU: Captain, we're dropping out of orbit! We're falling into the dead
sun. 
GREEN: Apply full power! Obey me! 
(It tries shooting Kirk) 
GREEN: No! Accelerate! Do not destroy the ship! Obey me! Obey! Obey! 
KIRK: Standby to activate warp drive unit. 
GREEN: No! Don't! 
(Green flies out of the ship's systems) 
KIRK: Activate warp drive! 
SPOCK: Activated, Captain. 
GREEN: Please, don't! 
(It leaves the ship completely and ends up enveloping the dead star, as
Enterprise slingshots around and away) 
KIRK: Is it gone? 
SPOCK: Affirmative. It fled the ship when it thought we would crash
into the dead star. 
GREEN [OC]: Don't leave me alone. Please, please. So lonely.

Stardate:
5373.4
Original Airdate: 15 Sep, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5373.4. We are in orbit around the planet of
the time vortex, the focus of all the timelines of our galaxy. Our
mission is to assist a team of historians in the investigation of
Federation history.
 [Guardian of Forever]
 (At the big rock doughnut in the middle of the
ruins, McCoy, a woman with a purple streak in her hair, and a giant
yellow bird are waiting) 
ALEEK: The travellers are returning. 
GREY: Cease review. 
(Kirk and Erikson the historiant appear) 
KIRK: What a trip, Bones. Orion, at the dawn of its civilisation. Even
just observing, not touching anything for fear of changing some piece
of history. What's the matter? Bones? 
(Spock is standing in the middle of the Guardian) 
MCCOY: Who's he, Jim? 
KIRK: What do you mean, who's he? You know Mister Spock. 
MCCOY: Afraid I don't, Jim. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 
SCOTT [OC]: Enterprise. 
KIRK: Beam up. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 (Four figures are beamed aboard) 
SCOTT: Captain, I was expecting there to be one of the historians with
you. But a Vulcan? 
KIRK: Explain yourself, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Sir? 
KIRK: I don't know what's going on, but the first officer of this ship
will be treated with respect. 
(An Andorian enters) 
THELIN: Captain, I assure you no one has ever treated me otherwise. 
KIRK: Who are you? 
MCCOY: Oh, I thought sure you'd know Thelin by now, Jim. He's been your
first officer for five years. 
SPOCK: Captain, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a game. 
KIRK: No, but if it's reality, what happened?
 Captain's log, supplemental. When we were in the
time vortex, something appears to have changed the present as we know
it. No one aboard recognises Mister Spock. The only answer is that the
past was somehow altered.
 [Briefing room]
 ERIKSON: Nothing. I can't find one thing we did
when we were in the vortex that could possibly have affected the
future. 
KIRK: But something was changed. 
SPOCK: It seems, Captain, I am the only one affected. The mission, the
ship, the crew, except for myself, remain the same. 
KIRK: But I know who you are, and no one else aboard does. While we
were in Orion's past, the time revision that took place here didn't
affect me. Kirk here. 
BATES [on monitor]: Sir, we've checked the Starfleet records Commander
Thelin asked for. 
KIRK: Your findings? 
BATES [on monitor]: There is no Vulcan named Spock serving with the
Starfleet in any capacity. 
THELIN: Did you also research the Vulcan family history requested? 
BATES [on monitor]: Yes, sir. I can relay that to your screen. (showing
relevant images) Sarek of Vulcan. Ambassador to seventeen Federation
planets in the past thirty years. 
SPOCK: That is not correct. 
KIRK: It is in this case. 
SPOCK: I wish to ask a question. What of Sarek's family, his wife and
son? 
BATES [OC]: Amanda, wife of Sarek. Born on Earth as Amanda Grayson. The
couple separated after the death of their son. (on monitor) The wife
was killed in a shuttle accident at Lunaport on her way home to Earth.
Ambassador Sarek has not remarried. 
SPOCK: My mother. The son, what was his name and age when he died? 
BATES [on monitor]: Spock. Age seven.
 [Guardian of Forever]
 KIRK: If we didn't change anything while we were
in the time vortex, someone else must have. Was the Guardian in use
while we were gone? 
GREY: Yes, but it was nothing unusual. We were scanning recent Vulcan
history. 
SPOCK: What time period? 
GREY: Twenty to thirty Vulcan years past. 
KIRK: Was there any notation on the death of Ambassador Sarek's son? 
ALEEK: Yes. The boy is recorded as dying during the maturity test. 
SPOCK: The kahs-wan, a survival test traditional for young males. 
ALEEK: The date was 
SPOCK: The twentieth day of Tasmeen. 
THELIN: How do you know this? 
SPOCK: That was the day my cousin saved my life in the desert when I
was attacked by a wild animal. 
KIRK: This cousin, what was his name? 
SPOCK: I do not recall clearly. I was very young. He called himself
Selek. He was visiting us, but I never saw him after that. 
KIRK: Spock, did Selek look like you do now? 
SPOCK: I believe so, Captain. And I know what you're thinking. It was I
who saved myself that other time. 
KIRK: But this time, you were in Orion's past with us when the
historians had the time vortex replay Vulcan history. You couldn't be
in two places at once, so you died as a boy. Guardian! Did you hear
that? 
GUARDIAN: I hear all. 
KIRK: Is it possible for Spock to return to Vulcan and repair the
timeline that has been broken so all is the same as before? 
GUARDIAN: It is possible if no other major factor is changed. 
SPOCK: I do not remember everything. There is a vague memory from a
child's point of view, but the details are not clear. 
KIRK: You have to remember, for you and your mother to live. 
SPOCK: Yes. I will need a Vulcan desert soft suit and boots, and a
small selection of streetwear circa 8877 Vulcan years. The carry bag
should be of the same period. 
KIRK: You've got it. I'll order the wardrobe section to prepare it now.

THELIN: This change in the timeline will put you in my place, yet I am
not aggrieved. 
SPOCK: Andorians are not known for their charity. 
THELIN: True. A warrior race has few sympathies, but one we do possess
is for family. In your time plane, you will live and so will your
mother. That is valuable. Live long and prosper in your world,
Commander Spock. 
SPOCK: And you in yours, Commander Thelin. 
(The carry bag is beamed down) 
KIRK: Nice to know the crew is efficient in this time plane, too.
Spock. 
SPOCK: I wish to visit the planet Vulcan, thirty years past, the month
of Tasmeen. Location, near the city of ShirKahr. 
GUARDIAN: The time and place are ready to receive you.
 Personal log, stardate 5373.5, subjective time. I
have returned to the past in an attempt to restore the future. I am
home and I had almost forgotten its beauty.
 [Vulcan]
 (Spock watches a group of children verbally
bullying another) 
BOY: Earther! Barbarian! Emotional Earther! You're a Terran, Spock. You
could never be a true Vulcan. 
Y SPOCK: That is not true. My father 
BOY 2: Your father brought shame to Vulcan. He married a human. 
(Young Spock lunges at him, but they dodge him easily) 
BOY: You haven't even mastered a simple Vulcan neck pinch yet, Earther.

SAREK: My apologies, visitor. I regret you were witness to that
unfortunate display of emotion on the part of my son. 
SPOCK: In the family, all is silence. No more will be said of it. Live
long and prosper, Sarek of Vulcan. 
SAREK: Peace and long life. You are of my family? 
SPOCK: My name is Selek, an humble cousin descended of T'Pel and Sasak.
I am journeying to the family shrine to honour our gods. 
SAREK: You have a long way to go. Will you break your journey with us
for a while, Cousin? 
SPOCK: I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin? 
SAREK: No, no. It was only that it seemed I know you. 
SPOCK: A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt. 
SAREK: No doubt. Well, come then. Allow me to welcome you to my home.
 [Courtyard]
 (Sarek calls Spock away from his enormous pet
sehlat - a big furry thing with large fangs) 
SAREK: Spock. Spock, being Vulcan means following disciplines and
philosophies that are difficult and demanding of both mind and body. 
Y SPOCK: Yes, father. 
SAREK: You constantly display your emotions. You have even been seen
fighting in the street. 
Y SPOCK: Yes, father. 
SAREK: The time draws near when you will have to decide whether you
will follow Vulcan or human philosophy. Vulcan offers much. No war, no
crime. Order, logic and control in place of raw emotions and instinct.
Once on the path you choose, you cannot turn back. 
Y SPOCK: Yes, father.
 [Sarek's house]
 AMANDA: I hope you were not disturbed by my son's
behaviour, Selek. 
SPOCK: No, my lady Amanda. Any child has much to learn. My young cousin
has a more difficult road to travel than others. 
AMANDA: You seem to understand him better than my husband. 
SPOCK: It is difficult for a father to bear less than perfection in his
son. Spock will find his way. 
AMANDA: I hops so. I respect Vulcan and all its traditions, but it is a
demanding life. 
SPOCK: The boy goes through the kahs-wan ordeal soon, does he not? 
AMANDA: Next month. 
SPOCK: But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen. 
AMANDA: Yes. Is something wrong? 
SPOCK: I seem to have lost track of time.
 [Courtyard]
 SAREK: Soon you will undergo your test of
adulthood in the desert. To survive for ten days without food, water or
weapon on Vulcan's Forge will demand more of you than anything ever
has. To fail once is not a disgrace for others. If you fail, there will
be those who will call you a coward all your life. I do not expect you
to fail. 
Y SPOCK: What if I do, father? 
SAREK: There is no need to ask that question. You will not disappoint
me. Not if your heart and spirit are Vulcan. 
(Sarek leaves, and young Spock goes to his pet) 
Y SPOCK: I-Chaya. what if I'm not a true Vulcan like they say?
 [Bedroom]
 SPOCK: (dictating) Personal log, stardate 5373.9,
subjective time. The timeline seems to have changed again. Yet I do not
believe I have done anything to disrupt it. My memory is quite clear
regarding the date my cousin saved my life, and it is tomorrow. The
kahs-wan ordeal is an ancient rite of warrior days. When Vulcans turned
to logic, they reasoned they must maintain the tests of courage and
strength to keep pure logic from making them weak and helpless.
 [Courtyard]
 (Young Spock has snuck out, and his pet wants to
go with him) 
Y SPOCK: No, I-Chaya, this is my own test. I have to do it alone. Stay.

(But the sehlat bounds after him anyway)
 [Bedroom]
 SPOCK: Of course. I should have remembered. It
wasn't the actual kahs-wan ordeal.
 [Desert]
 Y SPOCK: I-Chaya, go home. You are too old and too
fat for this. (whimper) That's how you always get around mother, but it
does not work with me. Go home, I-Chaya.
 Personal log. The boy Spock should be moving
toward the Llangon Mountains. He, I had much to prove to myself. The
personal ordeal upon which I embarked was meant to determine the course
my life would take.
 [Sarek's house]
 AMANDA: Sarek, our son and the visitor are gone. 
SAREK: This cousin, Selek, something strange about him. 
AMANDA: You don't think he'd harm Spock? 
SAREK: I don't know, Amanda. I will notify the authorities and ask them
to initiate a search.
 [Mountains]
 (Up in the mountains, I-Chaya is protecting young
Spock by taking on a green cat-like predator for him. But the cat kills
the Sehlat. Then Spock leaps on the cat's back and neck-pinches it) 
Y SPOCK: I-Chaya, good boy. 
SPOCK: I suggest we move away from this area before the le-matya
regains consciousness. 
Y SPOCK: Thank you for helping me and I-Chaya. 
SPOCK: It was my duty, Spock. 
Y SPOCK: Mother says you should always say thank you. 
SPOCK: The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness. 
Y SPOCK: Do you think I'll ever be able to do that neck pinch as well
as you? 
SPOCK: I dare say you will. Come now. 
(They walk on) 
Y SPOCK: You followed me. Why? 
SPOCK: I suspected you would go. You are worried about the kahs-wan
ordeal. 
Y SPOCK: I had to see if I could do it. A personal test. I cannot fail.

SPOCK: That is your father's wish? 
Y SPOCK: Yes, and my mother's. They, they confuse me. Father wants me
to do things his way, and Mother says I should. But then she goes 
SPOCK: She is a human woman, with strong emotion and sensitivities. She
embarrasses you with those traits, and you are afraid when you see them
in yourself. 
Y SPOCK: How did you know? 
SPOCK: There is some human blood in my family line. It is not fatal.
What you do not yet understand, Spock, is that Vulcans do not lack
emotion. It is only that ours is controlled. Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience in full. We have emotions but we deal with
them and do not let them control us. 
(I-Chaya collapses with a whimper) 
Y SPOCK: I-Chaya! 
SPOCK: The le-matya struck him with its poison claws in the fight. 
Y SPOCK: Is he dying? 
SPOCK: Yes.
 Personal log. Something unexpected has again
occurred. The sehlat, I-Chaya, was struck by the poisonous claws of the
le-matya he fought. He is dying, unless we can find a healer, and soon.
 [Mountains]
 SPOCK: We cannot get him back to the city to a
healer. He is too large to move. 
Y SPOCK: Then what? 
SPOCK: You are a Vulcan. What is the logical thing to do? 
Y SPOCK: I can bring a healer here. 
SPOCK: It is a long journey across the desert. There are many dangers.
I will go. 
Y SPOCK: No. This is my duty. No one else can do it for me. Will you
stay with him? 
(Young Spock heads back to the city) 
SPOCK: This did not happen before. My life decision was made without
the sacrifice of yours, old friend. I know there is pain. I can help a
little. Sleep now. 
(Young Spock avoids a carnivorous plant, and makes it back to the city)
 [Healer's house]
 HEALER: The hour is late. I trust your errand is
urgent? 
Y SPOCK: Most urgent, Healer. My sehlat fought a le-matya in the
Llangon foothills. He suffered a small wound, but the poison of its
claws is working in him now. Please, you must come with me. He needs
your healing. 
HEALER: You are Spock, son of Sarek, are you not? 
Y SPOCK: Yes, Healer. 
HEALER: I have heard of you. I have heard of a tendency toward what
humans call practical jokes. 
Y SPOCK: I did that once, two years ago. Healer, I would not call you
out unless a life was in danger. Have you ever heard the son of Sarek
was a liar? 
HEALER: No. That has never been said. Very well. Wait here and I will
get my medicines. 
Y SPOCK: Healer, please hurry.
 [Mountains]
 (The Healer and young Spock arrive in a hover-car)

SPOCK: It will not be long now, old friend. 
(As I-Chaya is tended) 
SPOCK: You made the desert crossing most efficiently. You will not
disappoint Sarek in your kahs-wan. 
Y SPOCK: I wanted only to help I-Chaya. He was my father's before he
was mine. To lose him 
SPOCK: A Vulcan would face such a loss without tears. 
Y SPOCK: How? 
SPOCK: By understanding every life comes to an end when time demands
it. Loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted.
I-Chaya's was not. 
HEALER: Spock. 
Y SPOCK: Yes, sir? 
HEALER: It has been too long. No antidote known will save his life. 
Y SPOCK: Is there nothing you can do? 
HEALER: I can prolong his life, but he will be in pain. Or I can
release him from life. I will need your decision. He is your pet. 
Y SPOCK: Release him. It is fitting he dies with peace and dignity. 
(And so I-Chaya goes to sleep in young Spock's arms.)
 [Sarek's house]
 Y SPOCK: I regret having troubled you in any way,
but it was necessary. 
SAREK: I trust you can explain why it was necessary? 
Y SPOCK: There was a decision to be made. A direction for my life had
to be chosen. I chose Vulcan. 
SAREK: It is good then. You have comported yourself with honour. We
will see I-Chaya is brought home from the mountains. 
Y SPOCK: Thank you, father. If you will excuse me now, I have some
business to conduct with schoolmates. 
SAREK: Business? 
Y SPOCK: A demonstration of the Vulcan neck pinch. Our cousin taught
me. 
SPOCK: I too must make my farewells. Your hospitality has been most
kind, but I must journey on. 
SAREK: You saved my son's life, Selek. There is no way I can fully
repay you for that. 
SPOCK: Try to understand your son, Sarek of Vulcan. It will be
repayment enough for me. 
SAREK: A strange request, but I will honour it. My home is yours if you
pass this way again. 
SPOCK: I think I shall not. Peace and long life. 
SAREK: Live long and prosper, cousin.
 [Guardian of Forever]
 GUARDIAN: The traveller is returning. 
KIRK: I sent the others up to the ship. What happened? 
SPOCK: One small thing was changed this time. A pet died. 
KIRK: A pet? Well, that wouldn't mean much in the course of time. 
SPOCK: It might, to some. 
KIRK: Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. 
SCOTT [OC]: Two to beam up. Aye, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 MCCOY: Well, well, well. So you two finally got
back from your vacation. While you've been running all over Orion's
creation, I've been running the annual crew physicals. You're the last
ones. 
KIRK: Welcome aboard, Mister Spock. 
MCCOY: Never mind the chit-chat. I've got my medical scanners all set
up for a Vulcan. I have to recalibrate every time I run a physical on
you, Spock. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, you do not know your good fortune. IF the times
were different, you would have to recalibrate for an Andorian. 
MCCOY: What's that supposed to mean? If that was supposed to be a joke,
Spock, I have to remind you Vulcans don't tell jokes. 
SPOCK: Times change, Doctor. Times change.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - One Of Our Planets
Is Missing
One
Of Our Planets Is Missing
Stardate:
5371.3
Original Airdate: 22 Sep, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5371.3. A huge cosmic cloud has been reported
moving into the outer fringe of our galaxy. Nothing like it has ever
been seen before. Starfleet Command has sent the Enterprise to
investigate as we're the only vessel in the vicinity of the phenomenon.
Our present position is in the Pallas Fourteen system, which contains
Mantilles, the most remote inhabited planet in the entire Federation.
 [Bridge]
 SULU: We will intercept the cloud in the vicinity
of Alondra, the outermost planet, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud. 
KIRK: Readings? 
SPOCK: It seems to be of irregular shape, some eight hundred thousand
kilometres across and about half that in depth. 
AREX: It's immense. Twice the diameters of Saturn, Jupiter and Neptune
together! 
KIRK: Put up our present position, Lieutenant Arex. 
AREX: Yes, Captain. 
KIRK: Reading, Spock? 
SPOCK: This is very curious, Captain. It computes as a strange
combination of matter and energy. 
SULU: Captain, look. 
AREX: Captain, Alondra has disappeared from navigation scan. 
UHURA: The cloud could have come between us and the planet. 
SPOCK: No, Lieutenant, the cloud has engulfed Alondra. Captain, the
planet seems to be breaking up. Its mass is definitely growing smaller.

KIRK: Spock, is it possible the cloud consumes planets? 
SPOCK: It seems a logical assumption, Captain. 
SULU: Sir, the cloud is changing course. 
KIRK: That's impossible. 
AREX: The course change is verified, sir. The cloud is now moving
directly toward the inhabited planet. 
UHURA: But if it continues on that course 
KIRK: Mantilles will die. Mister Sulu, increase speed to warp eight.
Push it to the limit. 
SULU: Yes, sir.
 Captain's log, supplemental. At warp eight, we
will intercept the cloud before it reaches the inhabited planet
Mantilles. But we are uncertain what we can do to stop a matter-energy
cloud which measures thousands of times more than our vessel.
 [Bridge]
 MCCOY: Jim, if we can't stop it, millions of
people will die. 
SPOCK: Perhaps more, Doctor. If planet annihilation is part of this
thing's nature, it might seek them out as instinctively as an amoeba
seeks out food. It may not consume only planets, but also stars. We do
not know yet whether it has any selective ability, but it could be a
thread to every planet in our galaxy. 
KIRK: Bones, I need an expert psychological opinion. Do we dare tell
the people on Mantilles, try to save a few who could get away? 
MCCOY: How much time do they have? 
AREX: Four hours, ten minutes, sir. 
MCCOY: It's certain there'd be planetwide panic. 
KIRK: Blind panic. 
SPOCK: On the other hand, notifying them may still save some small
fraction of the population, Captain. 
MCCOY: Who's the governor of Mantilles, Jim? 
KIRK: Bob Wesley. He left Starfleet for the governorship. He's no
hysteric. 
MCCOY: Then tell him. 
SULU: Coming up on the cloud, sir. ETA five minutes, ten seconds. 
KIRK: Thanks, Bones. Lieutenant Uhura, send a priority one call to
Governor Wesley on Mantilles. 
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, I'm getting unusual readings on the chemical identity
sensors. 
KIRK: What kind? 
SPOCK: Elements unknown in our periodic tables, Captain. I'm of the
opinion this cloud has come from outside our galaxy. 
SULU: Captain. 
KIRK: Evasive action. 
AREX: Aye, sir. 
(But the cloud wraps tendrils around the Enterprise) 
KIRK: Reverse full power. 
SULU: Full reverse, sir. 
MCCOY: It's still got us. 
SPOCK: The streamers are a combination of koinoenergy, almost an
ambiplasma with an unusually powerful attraction force. 
KIRK: Prepare to fire all phasers into cloud mass. 
SULU: Locked on. Phasers ready, sir. 
KIRK: Fire. 
SULU: Firing. No effect, Captain
SPOCK: The cloud appeared to absorb the phaser energy, Captain. 
(The ship is shaken) 
MCCOY: We're floating inside the cloud. 
UHURA: All decks report considerable shaking up, but no damage, sir. 
SULU: Captain, objects approaching on the bow. 
KIRK: Deflector shields on. 
AREX: Shields up and operating, sir. 
SULU: More objects approaching aft, sir. 
KIRK: Analysis, Spock? 
SPOCK: The objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter. 
SCOTT [OC]: Engineering to Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Captain, the power drain on the shields is
too heavy to hold for any length of time. 
KIRK [OC]: I know, Scotty.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Scotty, prepare the shields for an
antimatter charge. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. Engineering out. 
SULU: Antimatter charge ready, sir. 
KIRK: Fire. 
(More blobs approach the ship) 
KIRK: Double the charge. 
SULU: Ready, sir. 
KIRK: Fire. 
(The blobs disappear) 
KIRK: Well, Spock, any conclusions? 
SPOCK: Only the beginning of a theory, Captain. It is possible this
cloud in which we are entrapped is a living thing. The cloud is alive.
Yes, Captain, its components appear similar to those found in living
organisms. 
KIRK: Bones, any opinion? 
MCCOY: There's some resemblance. I don't know how much we can depend on
it. But I'll tell you one thing. We have to get out of this area. Those
mists out there are acting something like a macromorphase enzyme. If
the shields don't stay up, the hull will be corroded and we'll all be
broken down into nice digestible particles. 
SPOCK: I am inclined to agree with the Doctor, Captain. The mass of the
planet Alondra has been steadily growing smaller since we've been in
here. 
UHURA: Captain, I have a subspace radio message coming in from Governor
Wesley of Mantilles. 
KIRK: Transfer it to my quarters. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, use your scanners to assemble a diagram of the
cloud's composition and feed it to the library computer.
 [Kirk's quarters]
 WESLEY [on monitor]: Three and a half hours, Jim.
That's not enough. Even if I had the ships available to totally
evacuate the planet. 
KIRK: You have time to save some people, Bob. 
WESLEY [on monitor]: That won't be long enough either, but it'll have
to do. 
KIRK: How are you going to choose? 
WESLEY [on monitor]: There is no choice, Jim. We'll save the children.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: In three hours and twenty minutes the cloud
will reach Mantilles. Millions of people will die. I need your help,
gentlemen. Your analyses? 
SPOCK: If we assume the cloud is a living being, we must also assume it
needs some kind of food to sustain itself. 
KIRK: Agreed. Judging from the disappearance of Alondra, the cloud
lives on the energy it converts from the planets it consumes. 
SPOCK: Exactly. It is like a huge bull grazing here and there in the
pasture of the universe. 
KIRK: What about those blobs, Bones? 
MCCOY: I think they perform the same function as teeth. They break up
the larger chunks of matter for digestion. 
KIRK: Lieutenant, let's see what the scanners have come up with on the
cloud's composition. 
(A vaguely familiar shaped object with bilateral symmetry and a central
dense core. The subtly makes my brain hurt.) 
KIRK: It seems to have some sort of anatomy. Arex, where are we on that
chart? 
AREX: Posting Enterprise position, sir. 
KIRK: The opening where we were drawn in seems to have closed. But
there's another opening up there on top. 
MCCOY: If this thing does have some kind of digestive system, we don't
stand much of a chance of making it that far. 
AREX: Three hours, five minutes until the cloud reaches Mantilles, sir.

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Arex. Since we appear to have only one way out,
we're going to take it. Mister Sulu, takes us to that central core
area. 
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. 
KIRK: And if this thing does have a stomach, we just might be able to
give it enough indigestion to make it turn away from Mantilles. 
(Later) 
SULU: We've reached the entrance to the central core, Captain. 
MCCOY: What do we do now, knock? 
(Enterprise shakes) 
KIRK: No need, Bones. Here we go. 
(The Enterprise is sucked in to an area with bits protruding from
walls, and the blobs following get blown up) 
UHURA: What are those things? 
MCCOY: I think we're in what corresponds to the small intestine. Those
things growing out of the wall would be similar to villi. 
KIRK: Villi? 
MCCOY: The human small intestine is lined with millions of them, to
absorb nutrients into the body. 
(Another explosion) 
SPOCK: Captain, those villi are antimatter. It the Enterprise touches
one of them 
KIRK: We'll explode. Mister Sulu, keep the deflectors up at all costs. 
SULU: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Incredible. They're destroyed on contact with the matter this
thing takes in and then they regenerate immediately. 
SCOTT [OC]: Scott to Bridge. 
KIRK: Yes, Scotty. 
SCOTT [OC]: Keeping the deflectors this high
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Is putting an enormous strain on the
engines, Captain. Especially the antimatter. What with the maximum
power demands and all, the reserve is falling fast.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: How much time do we have? 
SCOTT [OC]: Twenty one minutes, sir.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: But if the indicator goes below two
anti-kilos, the engines won't regenerate.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Thank you, Mister Scott. Mister Arex, try to
make your way through to the opening on the other side. 
AREX: Yes, sir. 
(Enterprise glides serenely along the jagged canyon) 
SULU: I can't hold it on course, sir. We're using all power. 
KIRK: Increase deflector shields to maximum. 
AREX: Screens to maximum, sir. 
(The ship slows, and seems to drift in a current)
 Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise has
only fifteen minutes left before her power is drained and we are left
helpless.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: If we don't stop the power drain right now,
that'll be the end of us. 
KIRK: And if we do stop, we'll be drawn into one of the villi and the
ship will explode. 
SCOTT: Captain, you said that villi are antimatter. If we could get a
piece of it, I could put it in the antimatter engine and it would
regenerate. We'd have enough power for the engines and the shields to
go on maximum again. 
KIRK: We need both the matter and the antimatter engines regenerated. 
SCOTT: Matter's no problem. We could beam aboard some of the planet
chunks out there. And we can cut a piece of the antimatter villi with
the tractor beams and transport it aboard like that. 
KIRK: Bring it aboard? If the antimatter touches the inside of the ship
or any of us, we'll be blown to bits. 
SCOTT: I can rig a force field box that'll hold the villi suspended in
the centre. Then I can take it into the antimatter nacelle, put it into
the regenerating chamber and release the forcefield by remote control.
 [Transporter room]
 (So a piece of villi is cut and Kyle transports it
into Scott's box) 
KIRK: Scotty, we've got ten minutes left. 
SCOTT: The force field is holding. Let's go.
 [Antimatter nacelle]
 (Things are spluttering due to lack of fuel) 
SCOTT: Well, that gives us two minutes. All right, Gabler, open it.
(They push the box in) Close it. 
(The spluttering stops) 
KIRK: Scotty, you've just given the Enterprise and Mantilles a chance
to live. 
SCOTT: Thank you, sir.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Situation, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: The cloud is now only forty two minutes, fourteen seconds from
Mantilles, Captain. And we have ascertained an important fact. This
being does have a brain. 
KIRK: Intelligent? 
SPOCK: Impossible to say at this moment, Captain. It has made only one
action which might be interpreted as intelligent. It changed course
from Alondra toward Mantilles. But that could have been an involuntary
response to the sensing of food. 
KIRK: Where is the brain located? 
SPOCK: That irregularly shaped object at the top of the core emanates
considerable electrical activity. 
MCCOY: It's pretty certain to be the brain, Jim. The functioning of the
brain is basically electric. 
KIRK: If we can reach it before the cloud gets to Mantilles, we might
be able to save the planet. We'll use the photon torpedoes to destroy
the brain. 
SPOCK: Captain, this is a living creature. Starfleet regulations 
KIRK: I know the regulations against the killing of intelligent life
forms, Mister Spock. But we don't know this life form is intelligent.
And we do know the people on Mantilles are doomed if we don't stop it.
If I have to be a judge, I decide in favour of saving Mantilles.
 Captain's log, stardate 5372.0. Spock and Uhura
are using our sensors to prepare a detailed chart so we may determine
targets for our photon torpedoes.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Am I doing the right thing, Bones? Once, I
said, man rose above primitiveness by vowing 'I will not kill today.' 
MCCOY: But you can't let this thing destroy over eighty million lives,
either. 
SPOCK: Captain, I have completed the analysis of the target area.
Unfortunately, the brain is so vast, our entire offensive armament will
not assure its destruction. However, the brain could be completely
destroyed if we convert the entire ship to energy, aimed at the brain's
cortex, and expend the energy in one mortal strike. 
MCCOY: That sounds like you're telling us to blow up the ship. 
SPOCK: I believe that is what I just said, Doctor. 
KIRK: Your figures are specific and absolutely correct, of course?
You're sure it will do the job? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Quite sure. 
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. 
SCOTT [OC]: Engineering. Scott here.
 [Engineering]
 KIRK [OC]: Mister Scott, prepare the self-destruct
mechanism in the Engineering core.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Computer control will be on the Bridge when
it's time to trigger it. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. 
UHURA: Incoming message, sir. It's Governor Wesley of Mantilles. 
KIRK: Put it on the viewscreen, Lieutenant. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. Go ahead, Governor. 
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Jim. 
KIRK: Bob. Is the evacuation proceeding? 
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: As best it can. There was some hysteria at the
beginning, but most agreed to let the children be taken off first. But
it's only five thousand children out of eighty two million people. 
KIRK: I know. 
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: We can see the cloud approaching, Jim. 
SULU: Thirty one minutes and four seconds to Mantilles, sir. 
KIRK: Bob, where's Katie? 
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Here, with me. 
KIRK: Don't worry, Bon. She'll be all right. Goodbye. 
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Goodbye, Jim. 
MCCOY: Who's Katie? 
KIRK: His daughter. She's eleven. Spock, is there any way we could
establish whether or not it is definitely intelligent? Perhaps a Vulcan
mind touch. 
SPOCK: It would require physical contact, which is impossible, Captain.
But I may be able to reach out with my mind. If we focus our sensors
onto the cloud's synaptic electrical impulses, the input could be
routed to the ship's computer for analysis into thought. 
UHURA: I can link in the universal translator and put it on the audio
system from here. 
KIRK: Can you do it in time? 
SPOCK: It is impossible to calculate, Captain. There are too many
unknown factors. I can only try to accomplish the link. No more. 
SULU: Twenty six minutes exactly to Mantilles, sir. 
KIRK: All right, Spock. Get at it.
 Captain's log, stardate 5372.1. The cloud will
reach Mantilles in seven minutes. Spock has been working on the
mechanics of reaching the cloud's thoughts, but I doubt if there's any
time left. And even if we do establish contact, can we communicate with
it and persuade it not to kill?
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: The procedure is ready, sir. 
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. 
SPOCK: Ready, Captain. [OC] Listen to me. Listen to me. You are not
alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. 
CLOUD [OC]: What? 
SPOCK [OC]: You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to
me. Listen to me. 
CLOUD [OC]: What you? 
SPOCK [OC]: I am another being. 
CLOUD [OC]: Being? Where? 
SPOCK [OC]: I am inside you. 
CLOUD [OC]: Inside? Explain. Within me? 
SPOCK [OC]: I am very small. And there are many of me. We are in a
spaceship within you. 
CLOUD [OC]: Explain. 
SPOCK [OC]: A small thing which holds us all. 
CLOUD [OC]: Within me? 
SPOCK [OC]: Within you. 
CLOUD [OC]: Explain. 
SPOCK [OC]: We came to think to you. You consumed us. You thought we
were food. 
CLOUD [OC]: Why? Why you think to me?
SPOCK [OC]: Many of us live on the things you consume. 
CLOUD [OC]: Things I consume? 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes. Many of us are on the thing near you now. Do not
consume it. 
CLOUD [OC]: Explain. 
SPOCK [OC]: The spherical thing ahead of you, the matter you intend to
consume, sense it closely. 
KIRK: How near is Mantilles, Mister Arex? 
AREX: The cloud will envelope it in three minutes, twenty seconds, sir.

CLOUD [OC]: Perceive many somethings. So small. 
SPOCK [OC]: They are beings. Alive, like you. They will all die if you
consume that thing. 
CLOUD [OC]: Too small. 
SPOCK [OC]: Explain. 
CLOUD [OC]: I am small. Some things I perceive too small. Not alive
beings. 
SPOCK [OC]: Listen to me. I'm going to come into your thoughts. And at
the same time, you will come into mine. 
CLOUD [OC]: Necessary? 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes. Very. 
CLOUD [OC]: Proceed. 
(Spock stands up and looks around) 
KIRK: Bones, he's the cloud. Its thoughts are here. Don't move.
Lieutenant, use the library computer. Put some views of the Earth onto
that screen. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: This is the thing we come from. Lieutenant, this is what I want. 
(Images of the ground from above, cities, children playing,
countryside. And the clock ticks down to 1) 
SCOTT: Awaiting your order, Captain. 
KIRK: A few seconds, Scotty. We have to give Spock that much. 
(Spock sits down again as the clock goes to zero) 
MCCOY: Jim, if we don't self-destruct now all those people will die. 
SULU: The cloud has stopped, sir. 
CLOUD [OC]: Comprehend. Not desire to consume other beings. 
KIRK: Quiet. 
SPOCK [OC]: There are many things in our galaxy like the one you just
perceived. 
CLOUD [OC]: Truth? 
SPOCK [OC]: Truth. You do not desire to consume other beings. It would
be best if you return to your origin. The way you came. Will you do
this? 
CLOUD [OC]: A long journey. 
SPOCK [OC]: Will you return? 
CLOUD [OC]: Will return to origin place. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, contact Governor Wesley. Tell him to bring his
ships back. 
UHURA: Yes, Captain. 
KIRK: Spock, you did it! The cloud is leaving. 
SPOCK: I believe so, Captain. There is a grid at the top of the brain
core. It uses it to sense. We can escape the cloud through it. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, let's get out of here, through that grid. 
SULU: Yes, sir! 
KIRK: Spock, what did you perceive? 
SPOCK: The wonders of the universe, Captain. Incredible, completely
incredible.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - The Lorelei Signal
The
Lorelei Signal
Stardate:
5483.7
Original Airdate: 29 Sep, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5483.7. The Enterprise is en route through an
unfamiliar sector of space where a series of Earth Federation ships
have disappeared mysteriously during the last a hundred and fifty
years. Recent joint discussions with the Klingon and Romulan Empires
have revealed that a starship has disappeared in this sector precisely
every twenty seven point three four six star years.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: If my calculations are correct, Captain, we
have twenty seconds to go. 
KIRK: Twenty seconds to what? That's what worries me. Lieutenant Uhura,
place the ship on Yellow Alert. 
UHURA: Aye, sir. Yellow Alert. 
SPOCK: Five seconds. Four, three 
UHURA: All stations report Yellow Alert status, sir. Captain, I'm
getting some sort of subspace radio signal. 
KIRK: Put it on ship's speaker. 
UHURA: It's more like music than a message. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are being probed. 
KIRK: From where? Can you trace it? 
SPOCK: The signal is coming from a star system twenty light years away.

KIRK: Can you identify it? 
SPOCK: It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of
this sector. 
KIRK: That's a powerful signal to reach here from that great a
distance. 
SCOTT: It seems to be calling us. 
KIRK: Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself. 
SPOCK: It does resemble a summons. 
UHURA: I find no resemblance to a summons, Captain. 
KIRK: Opinion noted. Set a course for the Taurean system, Lieutenant
Arex. Warp factor seven. 
(Later) 
CHAPEL: You wanted me, Lieutenant? Are you all right? 
UHURA: I am. But I want you to observe the men here. It seemed to start
when we picked up that signal, and it's gotten worse. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing
audio-visual suggestion, Captain. 
KIRK: So am I. 
(They are 'seeing' women with white hair) 
KIRK: Dimensional visions. Any idea what's causing them, Spock? 
SPOCK: Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe. 
UHURA: Sir, what visions? We don't see anything. 
KIRK: Miss Chapel, you don't see anything, either? 
CHAPEL: No, sir. 
KIRK: Take a medical reading, Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura, call Doctor
McCoy to the Bridge. 
UHURA: Sickbay, Doctor McCoy. Please report to the Bridge. Doctor
McCoy? No response.
 [McCoy's office]
 (He's seeing lovely things too) 
MCCOY: Magnolias in blossom. Beautiful.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: The signal's getting stronger, sir. 
KIRK: Re-scan your sensor readings, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Readings are still inconclusive. It is odd that only the men are
affected, Captain. I suggest 
(A planet wobbles into view. and the men go all misty. The Enterprise
enters orbit) 
SCOTT: Ship's log, stardate 5483.8. Engineering Officer Scott in
command. We are in orbit around planet two in the Taurean system.
Probes and sensors indicate there was once a vast civilisation here.
Lovely. Lovely. However, life readings are sparse and concentrated.
Captain Kirk is beaming down with a scouting party to investigate. 
UHURA: These figures just don't match up with Spock's. So far I count
three sensor readings that are off.
 [Planet surface]
 (A building that looks like frozen flames) 
KIRK: Fantastic architecture. Only an incredibly advanced race could
have built it. 
CARVER: You want all those routine readings, sir. 
KIRK: No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it. 
MCCOY: There is something compelling about it. 
KIRK: Yes, I feel it too, Bones. 
SPOCK: Captain, the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion.
I advise remaining at a distance until I can determine the extent of
its influence. The life forms are indicated in its centre. 
KIRK: There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go.
 [Temple]
 (The inner doors open to reveal a bevy of
beautiful white-haired, blue-eyed women.) 
THEELA: They are here. 
ALL: Oh, such wondrous ones. They honour us. 
THEELA: I am Theela, the Head Female. Welcome, James Kirk, Doctor
McCoy, Mister Spock. Welcome. 
(What, the redshirt is suddenly invisible? How rude.) 
SPOCK: The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences.
Their bodies appear to function on an unusual psychokinesis level. 
MCCOY: First time I ever admired a body function. 
KIRK: How do you know our names? 
THEELA: The Opto-aud revealed you to us. 
(She hums a note and a door slides back to reveal the Enterprise on a
viewscreen, including images of the Bridge) 
SPOCK: Tonal control. Fascinating. 
THEELA: The Opto-aud will reveal whatever is asked, Mister Spock. We
are grateful that you heard the signal, Captain. 
KIRK: The signal? A distress call, wasn't it? 
THEELA: I will explain its meaning later. We have prepared a feast to
celebrate your presence.
 Captain's log, stardate 5483.9. The beauty of this
place is unequalled. It's the answer to all of man's dreams. Exquisite
in every way. We're here to investigate, to investigate... The women
radiate delight.
 [Temple]
 (The men are lounging on rugs, being entertained) 
MCCOY: These are the most beautiful women in the galaxy. But where are
the men? 
THEELA: They occupy another compound. 
KIRK: That makes sense. 
WOMAN: Mister Spock. 
(She throws something to him, he fails to catch it. It hits his chest
and he falls unconscious. Kirk tries to get up) 
KIRK: Spock 
(They all fall over) 
THEELA: Take them to the slumber chambers. They must rest. 
MCCOY: Probably that nectar. It's potent as Saurian brandy. 
(Theela sheds a single tear)
 [Slumber chambers]
 (The men are awake again, and wearing a strange
circlet around their heads. McCoy seems older) 
MCCOY: Jim, Jim! 
(Kirk wakes on a huge four-poster bed, wearing a circlet. His face
seems more lined than usual. He tries to remove the circlet and fails)
 [Science lab]
 CHAPEL: Results of every scan run by the women
science teams. If there is an answer, it's here. 
COMPUTER: Computer on. 
CHAPEL: Summation of medical, biological, astrophysical scans. 
COMPUTER: Working. Probe directed at ship from planet surface is
severely enervating to humanoid males. Exposure causes increasing
weakness. Possibly to point of death. 
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura to Security Officer Davison. 
DAVISON [OC]: Davison here. 
UHURA: I want an all-woman security team on every transporter
immediately. No one is to transport down to the planet unless it is on
my order. 
DAVISON [OC]: Aye, aye, Lieutenant. 
CHAPEL: What are you doing? 
UHURA: Taking command of this ship.
 [Temple]
 (The landing party are in front of Theela, sitting
on a raised throne) 
SPOCK: We must return to our duties aboard ship. 
KIRK: Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have 
THEELA: You cannot leave, Mister Spock. You are needed here. Soon, all
the men on your ship will feel as you do. They are all needed, and they
will join us. 
KIRK: We must go. 
THEELA: Obstruct them. 
(The women easily overpower the men and throw them onto the cushions)
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: (singing) I dream of ... the gala lads ...
can I trow (really can't make much out) 
UHURA: Mister Scott, as senior Lieutenant, I'm taking responsibility
for the safety of this ship. 
SCOTT: Very thoughtful of you, love. 
UHURA: Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant Uhura recording. Due to
Chief Engineering Officer Scott's euphoric state of mind, I am assuming
command of the Enterprise, I accept full responsibility for my action.
A detailed account will be recorded later. Nurse Chapel, until further
notice, you will act as Chief Medical Officer. 
CHAPEL: Yes, Lieutenant.
 [Temple]
 KIRK: They've gone. 
SPOCK: Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will
help us. 
MCCOY: I wonder why they let me keep it. 
SPOCK: Perhaps they saw no practical use in it. 
MCCOY: Cortropine. Could help. It's a strong stimulant. 
KIRK: Go ahead. 
(At the door) 
KIRK: Locked. 
SPOCK: (with a medical scanner) If the lock is magnetised, this may
disrupt its field. 
(The door opens enough for them to get out. Then Theela enters) 
THEELA: Assistance! Assistance!
 [Planet surface]
 KIRK: The urn. It's the only place. 
(The men climb into a giant sculptured urn to hide from the women) 
THEELA: This way. 
(As the women get close, the circlets on their heads glow) 
WOMAN: They are not here, Theela.
 [Urn]
 THEELA [OC]: Come. They might have returned to
where they landed. 
KIRK: The headbands. Look at them. 
SPOCK: I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not
present. They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital
energy to the bodies of the women. 
KIRK: You mean they're actually draining our life forces? 
SPOCK: That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our
weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our
strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital. 
KIRK: How long do we have, Spock? 
SPOCK: We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain. 
MCCOY: Ten years? In four days, we'll be dead! 
KIRK: And useless to them. Theela said the other men of the crew would
join us here. They'll be lured into the same trap. We've got to contact
the ship. 
SPOCK: I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal
structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I
go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the
ship.
 [Temple]
 (There is no one around, so Spock hums the note
and turns on the Opto-aud) 
SPOCK: The equipment belonging to the men of the Enterprise, where is
it? 
(The screen shows it to be in a drawer under the throne) 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 
UHURA [OC]: Enterprise. 
(He has been discovered) 
SPOCK: Request rescue party. All-female. Repeat. All-female. All 
(He collapses)
 Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant Uhura
commanding. We have assembled an all-female rescue party in #
accordance with Mister Spock's request.
 [Temple]
 (Uhura and Chapel beam down with four security
women) 
THEELA: Greetings. I am Theela. Head Female of this compound. 
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura of the Starship Enterprise. We're here to
locate Captain Kirk. 
THEELA: Return to your ship. You are not wanted here. 
UHURA: Until we find Captain Kirk, we will not leave. 
(Theela sends her troops in) 
UHURA: Phasers on stun. Fire! 
(The women drop like stones. Uhura shoots Theela herself) 
UHURA: Search the temple. Parties of two.
 [Slumber chambers]
 UHURA: No sign of them anywhere. 
(From his bed, Spock sends a telepathic message) 
SPOCK [OC]: Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel. 
CHAPEL: Wait. 
UHURA: What is it? 
CHAPEL: I heard Spock's voice. 
SPOCK [OC]: Christine. 
CHAPEL: It is Spock. There must be a panel somewhere. 
(They find it) 
CHAPEL: Mister Spock! 
UHURA: Spock, what happened? 
(But he is incoherent)
 [Urn]
 (It has started to rain) 
KIRK: We've got to get out of here.
 [Sickbay]
 (Chapel gets the circlet off the old, wizened
Spock. 
CHAPEL: Spock, Oh, Spock. 
SPOCK: Instruct female engineer to divert ship's energy into deflector
shields. Block probe. 
CHAPEL: We tried that. 
SPOCK: Use all ship's energy. Everything channelled to the shields.
Hurry, Christine.
 [Temple]
 (The stunned women are coming round) 
UHURA: Release Captain Kirk and his men or we will destroy your temple.

THEELA: Wait! I will tell you everything. 
(She turns on the Opto-aud) 
THEELA: The past. Reveal it. 
(Images appear - first male and female) 
THEELA: This is the race from whom we are descended. They came to this
planet when our homeworld began to die. They built this place and all
surrounding it. They did not know this planet drains humanoid energy.
But the women's bodies developed a glandular secretion, enabling them
to survive and to manipulate certain areas of the males' brains,
influence their emotional senses. Ultimately, it drained the men,
caused them to weaken and die. 
(Meanwhile, the urn is filling up with water, and the men can't get
out) 
THEELA: To survive, we must vitalise each twenty seven years of your
time. 
WOMAN: Instead, we are eternal prisoners. We neither age nor die. We
are unable even to bear children. 
UHURA: What about Captain Kirk and the others? Can the Opto-aud locate
them? 
THEELA: We shall see. The men of the Enterprise, reveal them. 
(It does) 
UHURA: They're drowning! Where are they? 
THEELA: The nearest water accumulation is many cusecs from here. 
UHURA: That looks like a pool or a tub. 
THEELA: It is the urn in the garden.
 [Planet surface]
 UHURA: Phasers on setting one. Fire. 
(The urn is blown to bits and the men washed out, unconscious)
 [Sickbay]
 (Chapel presses some buttons, and a golden glow
appears around her patients) 
CHAPEL: No results, Captain. We've tried everything we know. 
SPOCK: Perhaps the transporter is the key. 
MCCOY: Key to what? 
SPOCK: Our restoration. It holds the molecular pattern of our original
bodies when we beamed down to the planet. 
KIRK: Spock. Can the transporter be programmed to re-pattern us as we
were? 
SPOCK: Possibly. But the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to
one.
 [Planet surface]
 (The four old men are beamed down) 
SPOCK: We are on the surface, Mister Scott. Reprogram the transporter
as previously directed.
 [Transporter room]
 CHAPEL: But this has never been done before.
Suppose it fails? 
SCOTT: Their patterns'll break up, scatter in space. Transporter
reprogrammed, Mister Spock. 
KIRK [OC]: Beam us up, Scotty. 
UHURA: Scotty, we're losing them! 
(The four figures finally materialise) 
KIRK: Did it work? 
UHURA: You're more handsome than ever.
 [Temple]
 (Theela destroys the transmitter) 
THEELA: Tell Captain Kirk we have kept the agreement. 
UHURA: A crew of women will bring a ship back. You'll be transported to
the first suitable planet. 
THEELA: How quickly will we become as other women? 
UHURA: Doctor McCoy says it should only take a few months. 
THEELA: A life of hope. New learning. Perhaps love. Oh, it is a much
better future than immortality.

Tribbles, More Troubles
Stardate:
5392.4
Original Airdate: 6 Oct, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5392.4. The Enterprise has been assigned to
escort two robot grain ships to Sherman's Planet, which has been struck
by crop failures and famine. This shipment of seed grain,
quintrotriticale, is necessary to the survival of the colonists. We are
breaking course to Sherman's Planet to investigate what appears to be a
Klingon battle cruiser pursuing some kind of smaller ship. Observation
may confirm a rumour that the Klingons have a new weapon, type so far
unknown.
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Captain, it is a Klingon ship. Rapidly
closing on its target. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate the smaller vessel is a one-man scout ship of
common design. 
SULU: They're firing on him. 
(Explosions happen around the little ship) 
KIRK: Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. Ahead, warp factor
six. Scotty, lock the transporter on that small vessel. We're going to
rescue that pilot. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, aye, Captain.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: Locking on.
 [Bridge]
 (Finally, the Klingons manage to hit the fleeing
ship) 
KIRK: Open hailing frequencies. Klingon battle cruiser, identify
yourself. You are violating Federation space. Identify yourself. Stop
firing on scout ship. 
(Lots more misses) 
KIRK: Arm all phasers. Deflector shields up. 
SULU: Phasers armed. Shields up. 
KIRK: Ahead warp factor eight. Klingon battle cruiser, identify
yourself. 
(At last, they blow up the scout ship) 
SULU: They got him. 
KIRK: Scotty, have you got that pilot yet? 
SCOTT [OC]: I don't know, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: That Klingon (mutter). That blast
decalibrated the integration parameters.
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Captain. 
(The Klingon ship is coming straight for them. Red Alert sounds. A
wibbly energy field is fired at Enterprise) 
KIRK: The new weapon. Spock? 
SPOCK: Some kind of field effect, Captain. It will hit us in precisely
four seconds. It produces a most remarkable (the weapon hits)
disruption.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: Now, what 
(He mutters and works the controls)
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Our engines are dead. 
SPOCK: Captain, we have been hit by a kind of projected stasis field.
Our matter-antimatter generators are disabled. We are paralysed. 
KIRK: Fire phasers. 
SULU: The phasers don't work, sir. 
SPOCK: The photon torpedoes will not respond, either. The stasis field
disables all higher-order field and warp functions. 
UHURA: Well, we could always throw rocks. 
SPOCK: This new Klingon weapon must be one of surprising power if it
can immobilize a starship. The energy drain on the Klingon ship would
be enormous. 
KIRK: Scotty, did you get that pilot? 
SCOTT [OC]: I got him in the beam, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: But I can't integrate him. The system's
been discoordinated. 
UHURA: Captain, I have a message coming in, sir. 
KIRK: Put it on the viewscreen. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: Ah, Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Release my ship. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: I'd be delighted to, Captain Kirk, if you will
turn over the pilot of the little ship. 
KIRK: That ship was a Federation-built craft. The pilot is under our
protection. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: He has committed ecological sabotage. If I have
to take him by force, I will. 
KIRK: The first Klingon to step aboard this ship will be the last
Klingon. Full security alert, Mister Spock. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid, Captain Kirk, you'll find your
phasers no longer work, nor any of your weapons. 
UHURA: Mister Spock, I'm losing contact with our robot ships. They're
not held by the stasis field and they're moving out of range. 
KIRK: What was that? Lieutenant, cut off that frequency. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. (Koloth is cut off) The robot ships, they're moving
off. 
KIRK: They still have power? We still control them? 
SULU: Affirmative, sir. 
KIRK: Bring them back, Mister Sulu. Have them ram the Klingon ship. 
SPOCK: Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain. 
KIRK: I can afford even less to lose the Enterprise. Open the hailing
frequency again, Lieutenant. Captain Koloth. I'm going to give you one
last chance to release the Enterprise. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: You're going to give me one chance? (he gets
the message about the ships) It won't work, Captain Kirk. 
(transmission ends) 
KIRK: It will work, or he'd still be gloating. Bring the robot ships in
from two different angles, Mister Sulu. 
(The Klingons fire two more stasis beams) 
SPOCK: Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require. 
(The new beams fail to reach their targets, then they all fail and
Enterprise is free) 
SPOCK: They couldn't maintain the stasis field. 
KIRK: Keep your phasers locked on target, Mister Sulu. Hold your fire
until they fire first. 
SULU: Aye, sir. Phasers locked on. 
(The Klingons fire at a robot ship) 
SPOCK: Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it. 
SULU: They're veering off. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate their power cells are almost exhausted. They
probably don't have the strength for a prolonged battle now. 
KIRK: Scotty, can you integrate that pilot now?
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: I think so, Captain. 
KIRK [OC]: We'll be right there.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Call McCoy to the Transporter room. Spock.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: Have you got him? 
SCOTT: Just putting him together now, sir. 
(A chubby figure solidifies, together with three piles of small pink
fluffy objects) 
KIRK: I think we know that man. 
SPOCK: It appears to be 
MCCOY: I don't want to think about it. 
KIRK: Cyrano Jones! 
SCOTT: And he's got tribbles with him. Tribbles!
 Captain's log, supplemental. Our rescue effort has
given us some knowledge of the new Klingon weapon and the presence of
Cyrano Jones, intergalactic trader and general nuisance.
 [Transporter room]
 JONES: Captain Kirk. Friend Kirk. 
KIRK: Seal off the area, Ensign. You know the law about transporting
animals proven harmful. 
JONES: Captain, these are safe tribbles. 
MCCOY: There's no such thing as a safe tribble. 
SPOCK: A safe tribble would be a contradiction in terms. Tribbles are
well known for their proclivities in multiplication. 
JONES: And they breed fast, too. And that's why these tribbles are
safe. They don't reproduce. 
MCCOY: Don't reproduce? 
JONES: I've had them genetically engineered for compatibility with
humanoid ecologies. See how friendly and loveable they are? And not a
baby in the bunch. They're great pets and profitable, too. 
KIRK: Jones, how did you get away from Space Station K7? You were
supposed to clean up all the tribbles there. 
JONES: Oh, well, I managed a short parole. I found some help. This is a
tribble predator. It's called a glommer. 
(He holds up a pyramid-shaped thing with four legs, six horns and two
eyes on long stalks) 
JONES: Watch. 
(The glommer pounces over a tribble, and we don't get to see the
details) 
MCCOY: Well, at least it's neat. 
KIRK: Why were the Klingons chasing you, Jones? 
JONES: How should I know? Klingons have notoriously bad tempers. 
SPOCK: That may be true, but they rarely enter Federation space and
fire on Federation vessels without reason. 
KIRK: They did mention ecological sabotage. 
JONES: Me? A saboteur? Ridiculous. 
KIRK: Captain Koloth was pretty emphatic. 
JONES: It was such a little thing. I can't understand at all why they
got upset. 
KIRK: What did you do? 
JONES: I only sold them some tribbles. 
KIRK: You sold tribbles on a Klingon planet? 
JONES: Well, I didn't know it was a Klingon planet. 
KIRK: Tribbles don't like Klingons. That should have given you some
clue. 
JONES: Klingons like tribbles even less. It was lucky you came along
and saved me when you did, Friend Kirk. I couldn't have outrun them
much longer. 
KIRK: According to our computer files, Jones, you are in violation of
three Federation mandates and forty seven local ones. You're confined
until we complete our mission. Then we'll turn you over to the proper
authorities. 
JONES: Captain, couldn't we talk this over? I didn't think so. 
(If you're the only person in the universe who is reading this and does
not know about the  Trouble With Tribbles,
click the link and learn)
 [Medical lab]
 (McCoy is examining a pink tribble)
 [Briefing room]
 MCCOY: Jim, Cyrano Jones is right. These tribbles
don't reproduce. They just get fat. I don't think we have anything to
worry about. 
KIRK: Not about tribbles, anyway. I am concerned about that new Klingon
weapon. 
SPOCK: It is an energy-sapping field of great strength, Captain. It
immobilizes a starship and its weapons capability. But apparently, it
also immobilizes the attacking ship's abilities at the same time. 
SCOTT: Aye, and if that's true, then it's a weapon that leaves them as
helpless as it does us. 
SPOCK: I believe I just said that, Mister Scott. 
KIRK: The practical advantages of such a weapon would seem to be
limited. 
SPOCK: Perhaps, but there are logical applications. The key question
is, how long does it take them to recharge? They will probably attack
us again as soon as they are back up to power. And they will probably
begin by destroying the other robot ship to prevent us from repeating
the same trick. They want Cyrano Jones very badly. 
MCCOY: He really doesn't seem the saboteur type, Jim. 
KIRK: Yes. Status report on the damaged grain ship, Scotty? 
SCOTT: Well, sir, we've managed to transfer all the grain aboard, but
it severely limits us. We filled the shuttlecraft hangars, all our
extra holds, and we've even got containers of that wheat, that
quintrotriticale, in the corridors of the ship. And then we've got that
other robot ship to escort, too. I don't like it at all, sir. 
KIRK: Nor do I, Mister Scott, but we've got to do it. Sherman's Planet
needs that grain desperately. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir, but we've got tribbles on the ship, quintrotriticale
in the corridors, Klingons in the quadrant. It can ruin your whole day,
sir. 
(And big fat pink tribbles are 'sniffing' around the containers. So big
and fat that the glommer cannot quite cope with them)
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Captain, sensors are picking up a Klingon
battle cruiser. 
KIRK: Deflector shields up. Stand by phasers. (rolls a tribble off his
chair) How fat do these things get? 
SULU: Klingon ship approaching rapidly. Within phaser range in thirty
seconds. 
SPOCK: Obviously, they can recharge their power in a matter of hours. 
KIRK: Use the robot ship as a decoy. Have it change course and move
off. We'll use it again to give the Klingons trouble. They can't
control more than one ship at a time with their stasis field. 
SULU: Beginning evasive manoeuvres. 
SPOCK: The Klingon seems to be veering off. My mistake, Captain. They
were not veering off. They were attacking the grain ship. 
SULU: But they didn't destroy it. They only wrecked the propulsion
units. They left the cargo intact. 
SPOCK: Captain Koloth is quite a marksman. 
SULU: They've changed course. They're coming in again. 
KIRK: Ready phasers. 
SULU: Phasers armed and ready, sir. 
(The Klingons fire two shots at Enterprise. The shaking of the ship
makes some containers fall over and break open. Kirk returns fire, then
comes an attempt with the stasis beam. Meanwhile, little pink tribbles
are becoming giant pink tribbles.) 
KIRK: Photon torpedoes. Fire one. 
SPOCK: They're running away. Very odd. They did not use their stasis
weapon at all. 
KIRK: Perhaps they haven't had enough time to recharge it. 
SPOCK: Or the purpose of the attack was something else. 
SULU: They disabled the robot ship. 
KIRK: Scotty, put a tractor beam on it. We'll take it in tow. 
SPOCK: Captain, that could be exactly what they want us to do. Tow the
robot and limit our available power. We're carrying the extra mass of
the first ship's cargo, and now we have the second one in tow. That
requires a great deal of power we won't be able to use in battle. 
KIRK: That seems logical. 
SPOCK: Thank you. 
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock, do you have any ideas? 
SPOCK: We could always throw tribbles at them. 
KIRK: I thought Vulcans didn't have a sense of humour. 
SPOCK: We don't, Captain. 
(The glommer looks like a jockey on the back of a tribble) 
SCOTT: Captain, we've got broken cargo containers in all the corridors,
and the tribbles are eating the grain. 
KIRK: Get Cyrano Jones up here. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir. 
KIRK: Any sign of Captain Koloth's ship? 
SULU: Nothing, sir. 
KIRK: Keep scanning. 
JONES: Captain Kirk, what can I do for you? Some Spican flame gems
perhaps? 
KIRK: Your tribbles are all over my ship. My security men can't find
them all. 
JONES: You need better security men, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Jones, you are in enough trouble already. 
JONES: Captain, a harmless little tribble. What can they hurt? 
KIRK: Harmless, maybe. Little? (pushes a beach ball off his seat) In
any case, they're eating the quintrotriticale. 
JONES: The what? 
KIRK: The wheat! 
JONES: They're hungry, Captain. 
KIRK: So are the people on Sherman's Planet. A little tribble doesn't
eat much, a big tribble does. And these are growing. Jones, is this the
ecological sabotage the Klingons are so mad about? 
SULU: Captain, the Klingons are coming back. 
KIRK: Speak of the devil. 
(McCoy enters) 
MCCOY: Jim, there's something about these tribbles. 
KIRK: Later, Bones. (pushes one nearly as big as himself off his chair)
Mister Sulu, release the robot ship. We'll swing back and pick it up
later. Deflector shields up. Stand by photon torpedoes. And all
noncombatants off the Bridge.
 Captain's log, supplemental. The Klingon ship
under command of Captain Koloth is forcing us into a battle for custody
of Cyrano Jones for reasons still unknown.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Contact in thirty seconds. 
KIRK: Ready photon torpedoes. Fire one. 
SULU: One fired. 
(The Klingons fire their stasis beam, destroying the torpedo and
grabbing the Enterprise) 
SCOTT: That's done it. We're caught. 
UHURA: Message coming in, sir. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: Ah, Captain Kirk. We'll take control of your
ship now. 
KIRK: Not if I can help it. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: I want your prisoner. 
KIRK: Much as I hate to admit it, Captain Koloth, Cyrano Jones is a
citizen of the Federation and entitled to Federation protection. I
must, much as it pains me, refuse your request. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: It is not a request. Don't force me to take
steps that we will both regret. 
KIRK: Close channel, Lieutenant. 
UHURA: With pleasure, sir. 
SPOCK: Aren't you going to sit down, sir? 
(The pink tribble on the Captain's chair is definitely bigger than Kirk
now) 
KIRK: I think I'll stand.
 [Klingon Bridge]
 KOLOTH: Implement boarding plan C. 
KORAX: Yes, sir.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Mister Scott, we're going to implement
Emergency defence plan B. 
SCOTT: Plan B, sir? 
KIRK: Mister Spock suggested it.
 [Klingon ship]
 (The boarding hatches open, and giant pink
tribbles enter the Klingon ship. The Klingons are horrified)
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: Emergency plan B complete, sir.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant.
Captain Koloth, are you ready to release my ship? 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: Release your ship? Kirk, you are monotonous. 
KIRK: You don't know yet, do you? 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: Know what? 
KIRK: That we have immobilized your ship worse than you have
immobilized ours. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: I doubt that. Our instruments report nothing
except some undue transporter activity and (a tribble rolls behind him)
Kirk? Tribbles? 
KIRK: Tribbles.
 [Klingon Bridge]
 KOLOTH: Kirk, Cyrano Jones took a Klingon genetic
construct, an artificial creature from one of our planets. We must have
it back. It was designed to be a tribble predator. We are prepared to
go to war if we have to.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: You must have others. 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: This was the first one, Kirk. We need it in
order to grow others from it. We need it to get rid of the tribbles
 [Klingon Bridge]
 KOLOTH: Jones sold before they completely overrun
the planet.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: And that's all you want? 
KOLOTH [on viewscreen]: Jones is not that important.
 [Klingon Bridge]
 KOLOTH: We must have the glommer.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Oh, well, if that's all. Mister Scott,
transport the glommer over to the Klingon ship. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 JONES: You can't do this to me. Under space
salvage laws, he's mine. 
SCOTT: A planetary surface is not covered by space salvage laws. But if
you want the little beastie that bad, Mister Jones, we'll transport you
over with it. 
JONES: I withdraw my claim. 
(The glommer is transported, and the stasis beam is switched off)
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Well, at least we can report the stasis
field is not as effective a weapon as we thought. The power drain is
too high and takes too long for the Klingon ship to recover to make it
practical. 
SPOCK: Agreed, Captain. Tribbles appear to be a much more effective
weapon.
 [Corridor]
 (A monster tribble is amongst the wheat
containers) 
MCCOY: Jones' genetic engineering was very slipshod. Jim. He may have
kept the tribbles from reproducing, but he didn't slow down their
metabolism. You see, they're not just giant tribbles, they're colonies.
 [Klingon ship]
 KORAX: Captain, the engine room is filled with
tribble. 
KOLOTH: Well, we can do something about that. (to the glommer) Attack. 
(But the door opens and it is full of one tribble. The glommer
retreats) 
KOLOTH: He did it to us again! That tin-plated, overbearing excuse for
a starship captain did it to us again. Blast that thing. 
(So they shoot the big tribble, which becomes an avalanche of little
tribbles) 
KORAX: Any other orders, sir? 
KOLOTH: (up to his neck in tribbles) Yes. Don't do that again. Ever.
 [Corridor]
 MCCOY: A simple shot of neoethylene will fix
everything. The tribble colonies will break down into their individual
units with a slower metabolic rate. And these really will be safe
tribbles now. 
JONES: Er, what about the Klingons? 
MCCOY: Well, unless they treat their tribbles too, that ship isn't
going to be big enough for all of them. 
KIRK: (looking up a Jefferies tube) Say, you didn't get this one,
Bones. 
MCCOY: Oh yes I did. 
KIRK: But it hasn't (then it did) Someday I'll learn. 
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. But you've got to admit, if we've got to have
tribbles, it's best if all our tribbles are little ones.

The
Survivor
Stardate:
5143.3
Original Airdate: 10 Oct, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5143.3. While patrolling the edge of the
Romulan Neutral Zone, the Enterprise has changed course to assist a
one-man vessel which has fallen victim to a meteor swarm. Sensors
indicate the occupant is still alive.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: Have you identified the vessel, Mister
Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes Captain, but you may find it difficult to believe. The
vessel is registered to Carter Winston. 
MCCOY: That's impossible, Spock. Carter Winston's been missing over
five years. 
(Kyle beams aboard a fair-haired man) 
MCCOY: Incredible. It is him. 
KIRK: Carter Winston. 
CARTER: It seems you gentlemen know me. 
KIRK: There are few in the Federation who wouldn't recognise your face,
sir. I'm Captain James Kirk, commanding this vessel. Mister Spock, my
first officer, Doctor McCoy, senior medical officer. 
MCCOY: I'm especially honoured to meet you, Mister Winston. My daughter
was going to school on Cerberus about ten years ago when the crop
failure occurred. The entire population would've starved, Jim, if
Winston here hadn't used his personal fortune to bring in enough food
and goods to carry them through the crisis. 
KIRK: One of the many stories I've heard about you, Mister Winston.
It's an honour for all of us to have you aboard. 
SPOCK: There is one person aboard who should be especially happy to
learn you are alive, Mister Winston. Lieutenant Anne Nored of our
security detail. 
CARTER: My fiancee? Anne's aboard this starship? 
SPOCK: We will notify her as soon as we've verified your credentials,
Mister Winston. If you have your identity tapes with you 
MCCOY: Spock! Of all the cold-blooded, inhospitable requests I've ever
heard. 
SPOCK: I believe our regulations are quite clear, Doctor. An immediate
identity check and medical examination are a standard requirement at
this point. 
KIRK: Spock is right as usual, Bones. 
CARTER: And I understand, of course. My credentials, Captain.
 The Enterprise has rescued a living legend, the
foremost space trader of our time. Carter Winston has acquired a dozen
fortunes only to use his wealth time and again to assist Federation
colonies in times of need or disaster.
 [Briefing room]
 SPOCK: Library computer, verify record tape on
Winston, Carter. 
COMPUTER: Working. Identification positive. Fingerprints positive.
Voice print positive. All licenses and registration in order. 
KIRK: Visual display of owner. Checks out. It seems we'll have a
distinguished passenger with us for a while.
 [Sickbay]
 CARTER: Is there some problem, Doctor? 
MCCOY: This instrument seems a little off. I've never gotten quite this
reading from a human before. 
CARTER: Are you suggesting I'm not quite human, Doctor? 
MCCOY: Of course not. Anyway, it's just a fraction off normal. It's
probably the instrument. They need to be recalibrated every so often. 
(Chapel enters) 
CHAPEL: The Captain is inquiring if the examination is completed,
Doctor. 
MCCOY: Yes, I suppose so. 
CHAPEL: And Lieutenant Nored is waiting to see Mister Winston once
you've certified his medical condition. 
MCCOY: Well, I certainly don't want to keep you any longer from your
fiancee. Show her in. 
(McCoy and Chapel leave, and a brunette enters) 
ANNE: Oh, Carter. 
CARTER: I'm sorry, Anne. I never thought we would meet again. 
ANNE: Carter, what is it? 
CARTER: When I left on that last trip, I fully intended to come back
and marry you, but my ship was disabled and I crashed on Vendor. I'm
told I was lucky I survived. 
ANNE: But you did survive. You're alive, and we're together again. 
CARTER: Anne, I'm changed. First there was surgery, skin graft,
regrowth of bone. After they put me together, they assigned one of
their people to me, and he nursed me back to health. 
ANNE: But, you said you've changed. How? I don't see any change. 
CARTER: It's over between us, Anne. I'm sorry, I can't explain why but,
I can't marry you. Ever.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Take the conn, Mister Spock. I'll be in my
cabin completing the report on Winston's rescue.
 [Kirk's quarters]
 KIRK: Come. 
CARTER: I hope I'm not intruding, Captain. 
KIRK: No, please come in, Mister Winston. 
CARTER: I've been down to examine my ship. They stowed it in the
shuttlebay. 
KIRK: Yes, I'm afraid it's pretty badly damaged. It's hardly worth
salvaging right now. I've had our engineering officer, Mister Scott,
examine it and make a report. It's here somewhere. He doesn't think
there's anything left in your ship except scrap value. 
(Behind his back, Carter Winston crosses his arms and glows, then turns
into a an orange creature poised on six slender tendrils. It drapes a
tendril around Kirk's shoulder. He falls unconscious and the thing
places him gently on his bed. Then the creature turns into James Kirk.)
 [Sickbay]
 CHAPEL: Well, I can't find anything wrong with
these instruments, Doctor. They check out, but the readings are still
slightly off. What about the rest of the tests on Winston? 
MCCOY: Well, some are off and some aren't. It has to be our error. Come
on. We'll start from the beginning and this time we're going to find
the answer.
 [Bridge]
 (Kirk enters) 
SULU: Weren't you going to your cabin, sir? 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three. 
SULU: Through the Romulan Neutral Zone, sir? 
KIRK: That was the order, helmsman. 
SULU: But sir, if we're caught there, the Romulans can confiscate the
ship. The treaty 
KIRK: I know the terms of the treaty, Mister Sulu, and I believe you
heard my order. 
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, the extreme long-range sensors show something in the
Zone. At this distance, I cannot determine precisely what it is. It
could be a trading vessel like Winston's. But it does not seem prudent
to take the risk of trespass into the Zone. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, I've spoken to Winston on this at some length. He
has assured me it is absolutely vital to get to Ratar Three in the
shortest possible time. The survival of the entire planetary population
may depend on it. 
SPOCK: An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship 
KIRK: I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't feel it safe, Spock.
Winston says his sensors detected no Romulans when he came through the
Zone last week. I'm satisfied he's telling the truth, and his word is
considered good. Isn't it? 
SPOCK: That has been his reputation. 
SULU: Course laid in, sir. 
KIRK: Execute. 
SULU: On course, sir. 
KIRK: You have the conn, Mister Spock.
 Ship's log, stardate 5148.7. First Officer Spock
recording. The Captain's course change has taken us deep into the
Romulan Neutral Zone.
 [Bridge]
 (Kirk has woken up in his quarters) 
KIRK: I'll take the conn, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Is something wrong, Captain? 
KIRK: I'm not sure. I went down to my quarters to dictate the accident
report and I seem to have fallen asleep. I've never done that before. 
SPOCK: Perhaps you needed the rest. We are on course through the
Neutral Zone, sir. 
KIRK: The Neutral Zone? We have no authorisation to enter it. Did you
order a course change, Spock? 
SPOCK: No, sir. You did. 
KIRK: Ridiculous. No captain of the Starfleet would do that unless it
was a matter of life and death. 
SPOCK: I believe that was the reason you gave, Captain. 
SULU [on monitor]: Weren't you going to your cabin, sir? 
KIRK [on monitor]: Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three.

SULU [on monitor]: Through the Romulan Neutral Zone, sir? 
KIRK [on monitor]: That was an order, helmsman. 
KIRK: That's enough, Spock. Mister Scott, take the conn. Spock. Mister
Sulu, plot a course to take the Enterprise out of the Neutral Zone at
warp eight. Lieutenant M'Ress, put the ship on Yellow Alert.
 [Turbolift]
 KIRK: Mister Spock, I don't remember giving those
orders. I left the Bridge, went to my quarters and fell asleep. That's
all. 
SPOCK: Perhaps Doctor McCoy should examine you, Captain. 
KIRK: Definitely. I've become subject to blackouts, I'm a possible
danger to the safety of the ship. I can't allow that.
 [McCoy's office]
 MCCOY: Oh, Winston. I was just finishing the tests
I ran on you. I don't think 
(But Winston has done his transformation into the alien, sent him to
sleep and has dragged the body away) 
(Later) 
ANNE: Doctor McCoy? 
MCCOY: Can I help you? 
ANNE: I don't know, Doctor. I just thought. Well, I have to talk to
someone. 
MCCOY: Oh now, let me guess. It's you and Carter Winston. He told me a
little about it when I examined him. 
ANNE: Doctor, what do I do? I still love him. 
MCCOY: Well, I'm sure he'd like to feel the same way about you, Anne,
but that may be impossible. Five years, that's a long time. People
change. 
ANNE: I haven't. What can I do? 
MCCOY: Well, if he asked you to forget him, I think you should try to
do just that. Do you think he'd want to deceive you? 
ANNE: Oh no. He's the gentlest, most thoughtful man I've ever known. 
MCCOY: Yes, but, my dear, if he doesn't want you and he has asked you
to forget him, then I suggest you take that as an honest concern for
you and do it. Forget Winston. 
(Kirk and Spock enter) 
ANNE: Thank you, Doctor. I'll consider your advice. (leaves) 
MCCOY: What can I do for you, Captain? 
KIRK: I want a complete medical examination, Bones. Something's just
happened 
MCCOY: I'm afraid I'll have to make it later today, Captain. I have too
many tests to process right now. 
SPOCK: Carter Winston's? 
MCCOY: That one's done. Tested out normal. 
SPOCK: Are you sure there is no possibility you made an error? 
MCCOY: Well, there's always that possibility. I'll go over them again
if you like. 
KIRK: No, that won't be necessary. I'll come by later for that
examination. Let's go, Spock.
 [Corridor]
 SPOCK: Captain, did you notice Doctor McCoy's
reaction when I asked him if there was any possibility he might have
made an error? 
KIRK: He said there's always that possibility. And that's not like
Bones at all. Come on.
 [McCoy's office]
 (No one is there) 
SPOCK: There are not many places one could hide in here. 
(There's a groan from behind the door)
 [Medical lab]
 MCCOY: I must have taken a little nap. 
SPOCK: Doctor, you are a man of curious habits, but I have never known
you to nap on the laboratory floor. 
KIRK: There's something wrong about this room. 
(He goes over to a biobed) 
KIRK: All right, Winston. You can come out now. I suggest you show
yourself, Winston, or whatever you are. 
MCCOY: Did you say I'm a man of curious habits? Jim's talking to a
table. 
SPOCK: I don't think so, Doctor. 
KIRK: There used to be only two examining tables in this room. Now
there are three. 
SPOCK: I just realised that. 
KIRK: This is a vial of Orientine acid, Winston. It will burn through
almost anything but this crystal. If you've never seen it work, I'll
demonstrate on you. 
(The table transforms into the alien) 
MCCOY: I saw that, but I don't believe it. 
SPOCK: A Vendorian, Doctor. Their planet is quarantined, and few people
ever do see them. Their ability to rearrange their molecular structure
into anything with the same general size and mass and their practise of
deceit as a way of life puts them off limits. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, get a security team down here on the double. 
MCCOY: Jim! 
(The Vendorian attacks all three of them at once and escapes down the
corridor) 
SPOCK: Spock to Bridge. Put me on ship's audio.
 [Corridor]
 SPOCK [OC]: All security teams, intruder alert.
Repeat, intruder alert. The intruder is a Vendorian capable of assuming
any shape or identity. 
(It changes into Carter Winston and looks for somewhere to hide. A
phaser is pointed at it) 
CARTER: Anne, what are you doing? 
ANNE: My job. It isn't hard to guess who the intruder is. You're the
only stranger aboard, Carter. 
(But he knocks the phaser out of her hand, and gets away just she picks
it up again and Kirk arrives) 
KIRK: Lieutenant Nored, you could've stopped him. Why didn't you fire? 
ANNE: I, I couldn't. I knew he had to be the intruder, Captain, but I
couldn't harm the image of the man I loved. 
KIRK: Lieutenant, he is not the man you loved. Carter Winston is dead. 
ANNE: I know that too, now. 
SPOCK: Security teams report no sign of the alien on this deck,
Captain. 
KIRK: I was afraid of that. Once out of our sight, he can become anyone
or anything aboard this ship. 
(Red Alert sounds) 
KIRK: Bridge, this is the Captain. What's happened?
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: Two Romulan battle cruisers, Captain. And
they're heading right for us.
 Captain's log, supplemental. Due to interference
by the alien Vendorian aboard, the Enterprise has been detected
violating the Romulan Neutral Zone. By the terms of our treaty, the
Romulans have a legal right to seize and impound the Enterprise. To
complicate matters, we have not been able to apprehend the Vendorian
responsible for putting us in this position.
 [Bridge]
 ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: You appear to have a
propensity for trespassing in the Neutral Zone, Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: It was not deliberate, I assure you. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: It never is. But the rules of the treaty are
clear. To contravene them would mean war. You will surrender your ship,
Captain. We will release you and your crew at the nearest outpost that
guards the Neutral Zone. 
KIRK: I'd like a few minutes to inform my crew. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: Very well. Five minutes, no more. 
KIRK: Kirk to Security. What's the status on the search for the
Vendorian? 
ANNE [OC]: No progress yet. We have all decks patrolled, but no one has
seen him. 
KIRK: Carry on, Lieutenant. The Romulans were expecting us, Mister
Spock. That wreck of Winston's ship was the bait to get a Romulan spy
onboard. And what better spy than a Vendorian who can shape at will.
When I went down to my cabin, he must have put me out long enough for
him to return to the Bridge and order the course change. 
SPOCK: It would seem so. 
KIRK: Open a hailing frequency Lieutenant M'Ress. 
M'RESS: (a lioness with a very long flowing mane) Hailing frequency
open, sir. They're waiting for us. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: I assume you are now ready to turn your ship
over to us, Captain. 
KIRK: Wrong assumption. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: Captain, you are outnumbered, outgunned and in
the wrong. I admire your courage, but I 
KIRK: I have no choice, Commander. You lured me here in direct
violation of the treaty. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: Lured, Captain? How could we lure a Starfleet
vessel into the Neutral Zone? 
KIRK: Through the use of a spy using the human form of Carter Winston. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: A spy? Come now, Captain. Your imagination is
creative but obviously out of control. 
KIRK: You used a Vendorian, which, I might add, is also a violation of
the treaty. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: Your five minutes are up, Captain. Either
surrender your ship or prepare to fight. 
KIRK: I will not surrender my ship.
 [Engineering]
 (Scott finds a man messing inside a panel) 
SCOTT: What are you doing? 
(The man grabs his throat, knocking him out, then carries on)
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Captain, our deflector shields are coming
down. 
KIRK: Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, what's happened to the shields?
 [Engineering]
 GABLER: Mister Scott isn't here, sir. 
KIRK [OC]: Get those shields
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Up again now. 
GABLER [OC]: I can't, sir. 
SULU: Hangar doors on the shuttlecraft deck are opening, sir. The
Vendorian must be trying to escape. 
KIRK: We need him. Override the controls and shut those doors. 
SULU: Doors closing, sir. 
KIRK: Spock, take the conn. Talk to the Romulans. Try to stall them.
And send a security team to the hangar deck. I'll be in Engineering.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK; What happened? 
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. I came up here to check the backup systems,
and there was a crewman taking this panel apart. That's all I remember.

KIRK: How long will it take to fix? 
SCOTT: Two hours, at least. 
KIRK: Get on it.
 [Corridor]
 ANNE: You're not getting past me this time. I've
learned my lesson. 
CARTER: Yes. He said you were like that, practical as well as warm and
lovely. You're everything he said you were. 
ANNE: Carter? What did he say? 
CARTER: Many things. Some were only feelings, deep feelings he couldn't
always express. He did love you. 
ANNE: How did he die? 
CARTER: Winston crashed on our planet, and he was tended by a
Vendorian. Me. He lived for almost a year before his body ceased to
function. 
ANNE: You are so much like him, his voice, his mannerisms. 
CARTER: That is the way of our people. The longer we stay in another's
form, the more we take on its memory, emotion, attitudes. Not totally,
but a great deal as time passes. 
ANNE: He did say he loved me. 
CARTER: As I do. In a sense, I feel some of the emotions he felt. His
love for you was very strong. Because I was there, it did not end when
he died. 
ANNE: Carter. 
CARTER: Anne, this is what I am. (changes into Vendorian shape) Can you
love this? (changes back) You see why I told you it would be best to
forget me? 
(Kirk arrives) 
KIRK: But unfortunately, I can't. 
(The Romulans fire at the ship, and Kirk and Anne are knocked off their
feet. Carter escapes)
 [Bridge]
 (Kirk enters) 
SPOCK: Direct hit, Captain. Damage to the secondary propulsion system.
The commander has apparently decided to fight. 
M'RESS: The Romulan commander is signalling, sir. I'll put it on the
screen. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: Captain Kirk, all our main batteries are
trained on you. To resist would be useless and wasteful of lives. Do
you surrender? 
KIRK: Without deflectors, we're just a clay pigeon for them. 
SPOCK: Practicality does suggest capitulation, Captain. 
SULU: Captain, the deflector shields are coming up again. 
KIRK: That's only one shield. 
SULU: Yes, sir, but it is between us and the Romulans. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, aim for the propulsion units of the lead Romulan
vessel. Prepare to fire phasers and photon torpedoes in combination. 
SULU: Phasers and torpedoes ready, sir. 
KIRK: Fire. 
(They disable the first ship) 
SPOCK: Second vessel firing now, sir. 
KIRK: Lock on second target. 
SULU: Ready, Captain. 
KIRK: Fire. 
SPOCK: Strange. We did no damage, but the Romulan is retreating anyway.

KIRK: They may believe we do have their spy. Scan the other vessel for
damage, if you will, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Second vessel power supply out. Crew unharmed. They should be
able to repair the ship in a few days. 
KIRK: Good work, Mister Scott. That deflector shield went up just in
time.
SCOTT: But sir, I haven't finished repairing the shield. I told you
it'll take hours, and it will. 
SPOCK: Interesting. 
KIRK: Then what was? Winston. 
SPOCK: It is not outside the realm of probability. If he could
rearrange his own atoms to become an examination table, one would have
to assume he could become a deflector shield. 
SCOTT: Will someone tell me what's going on? 
(The Vendorian enters) 
SCOTT: What manner of beastie is that? 
SPOCK: Your deflector shield, Mister Scott. 
ALIEN: I assume the danger to your ship is over. 
KIRK: It is. 
ALIEN: As it should be. I'm sorry if I endangered your vessel. 
KIRK: Why did you do it? 
ALIEN: Among my own people, I am a non-producer, useless. An outcast
fit only to do those tasks of the lowest order. The Romulans offered me
a life, something of value I could do. It is important to be of value
to someone. 
KIRK: What changed your mind about the Romulans? 
ALIEN: It seems, Captain, that I am more Carter Winston than I knew. He
loved life. He loved Anne. I couldn't allow the Romulans to harm any of
you because of him. 
KIRK: I understand. 
ALIEN: What will happen to me now? 
KIRK: You'll have to stand trial. But you did save the Enterprise from
the Romulans, and I will recommend that be taken into consideration. 
ALIEN: Thank you, Captain. 
(The Vendorian changes into Carter Winston) 
KIRK: In the meantime, I'm afraid I'll have to keep you under guard. I
think we've had enough of that little trick. 
ANNE: Captain, could you assign me that duty. 
CARTER: But you've seem me. You know what I am. 
ANNE: Form doesn't seem terribly important to me. As Carter Winston or
even just part of him, there's a better life for you than anything the
Romulans might offer. Can we talk about that? 
CARTER: I don't know. I 
KIRK: You have the guard detail, Lieutenant. 
(McCoy enters as Anne and Carter leave) 
MCCOY: You caught him. 
SPOCK: Acute observation, Doctor. 
MCCOY: I'm glad to see him under guard, Jim. If he'd turned into a
second Spock, it would've been too much to take. 
SPOCK: Perhaps. But then two Doctor McCoys just might bring the level
of medical efficiency on this ship up to acceptable levels.

The
Infinite Vulcan
Stardate:
5554.4
Original Airdate: 20 Oct, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5554.4. The Enterprise has been ordered to
survey a new planet recently discovered at the periphery of the galaxy.
 [Planet surface]
 (Green sky, extraordinarily elegant curved rock
formations, buildings with vegetation growing on them) 
SULU: Life readings are confused, sir. I can't decipher them. 
SPOCK: There is something else, Captain. I'm getting a reading of some
kind of power from that building) 
(Sulu glances up, the sun flashes and a miniature purple 'tree' thing
is at his feet) 
SULU: Well, now. What's this? Captain! Captain! 
KIRK: What is it, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: You're going to have to see this yourself, sir. 
(As he walks off, the plant gets up and follows him) 
KIRK: What is that thing? 
SULU: It's a mobile plant. When it stops, it's roots bore back into the
ground. They're all over the place. I think it likes me. 
KIRK: We always encourage our officers to make friends with the
natives. 
SPOCK: Captain, the power reading now includes an electronic probe. We
are being scanned. 
KIRK: Phasers on stun. Stay alert. Mister Sulu, stay here. 
(Sulu picks up his new friend, then drops it in pain.) 
SULU: Ow! Must have been a thorn.
 [Building]
 (Elegant smooth alien semi-organic design, with
flashing lights on two wall panels) 
SPOCK: The probe originates in this wall, as does an incredibly
powerful force shield. It appears to be an amalgam of devices designed
to defend and protect the city and this building in particular. 
MCCOY: Jim, I'm picking up a humanoid reading of incredible strength.
It's as if he 
SULU [OC]: Argh!
 [Planet surface]
 (Sulu is face down on the grass) 
MCCOY: He's been poisoned. Unknown toxin. 
KIRK: Can you help him? 
MCCOY: I can't get a correlation with any known poison. 
KIRK: Maybe the ship's medical computers. 
MCCOY: He's got about one minute to live unless I can find an answer.
Maybe dylovene. No good. Takes too much time to work if it does work. 
KIRK: Maybe a stronger shot. 
AGMAR: That won't be necessary. 
(Four green, tentacled aliens with eyes on stalks and medallions around
their 'necks' are standing there. Think asparagus) 
KIRK: Who are you? 
AGMAR: I am called Agmar. I believe we can help. 
KIRK: Are you getting a reading on them? 
SPOCK: A moment, Captain. The results are unclear. 
MCCOY: Now, just a minute. I can't let you, whatever you are, inject
him with some alien dew drop! 
AGMAR: To wait is to assure your friend's death. I must proceed. 
KIRK: Bones, let them help. 
SPOCK: Captain, these beings are of botanical origin. 
MCCOY: Intelligent plants? 
SPOCK: So it would seem. 
AGMAR: It is an antidote quickly absorbed. He should begin to respond
momentarily. 
KIRK: Thank you. 
AGMAR: Welcome to the planet Phylos. 
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy and Mister
Sulu. You seem to have been expecting us. 
AGMAR: Our instruments have tracked and scanned you. We did not wish to
reveal ourselves immediately. We are a peaceful race and we have a fear
of aliens. 
KIRK: What happened to him? 
AGMAR: He was bitten by the Retlaw plant. It is deadly only if
unattended. 
(This episode was written by Walter Koenig, by the way. Walter/retlaW,
get it?) 
KIRK: Your medication worked quickly. 
AGMAR: A minor achievement. 
MCCOY: Minor? Our science doesn't have anything that works that fast.
Yours must be incredible. The toxin level is decreasing fast. Body
readings up to normal. How is it you knew your antidote would work on a
human? 
AGMAR: There have been humanoid aliens here before. 
SPOCK: Your method of communication 
AGMAR: A voder, or translator. Most efficient. (the medallion) 
KIRK: I'm sorry, Agmar, but I don't like puzzles. Where are the rest of
your people? 
AGMAR: Come. I will show you.
 [Building]
 (Agmar opens one of the inner doors to reveal a
long corridor lined with giants) 
AGMAR: Our people. 
SPOCK: Nerve tissue. Mass density is exceptionally high. Readings
indicate the beings used almost seventy percent of their brains. A very
high ratio. 
KIRK: Your ancestors? 
AGMAR: No, only the generation before us. 
KIRK: Then, what happened? 
AGMAR: A human came. He brought sickness and death. But he also worked
to save us from his disease. 
MCCOY: There are evidences of gram-positive bacteria. It's carried by
humanoids without ill effect, but staphylococcus strains don't seem to
be native to this planet. It must have been like a plague. 
AGMAR: We had no way of knowing what was happening. 
KIRK: You were alive then? 
AGMAR: Very young. 
(A purple pterodactyl with tendrils for legs flies overhead) 
SPOCK: Plant life, Captain. Primitive and aggressive. 
(Kirk ducks and tries his phaser. Nothing) 
SULU: They won't work on any setting, sir. 
AGMAR: There is a weapons deactivator in effect here. Your destructive
machines will have no effect. 
MCCOY: I think it's after you, Jim. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 
(The pterodactyl grabs him, and he drops the communicator. More of the
flying plants arrive) 
MCCOY: Captain! 
(The rest of the party are grabbed) 
SULU: What do you think they'll do with us, sir? 
KIRK: Something tells me we've just been used as a diversionary tactic.
Look. 
(They fly away with Spock) 
AGMAR: I'm sorry, Captain Kirk, but there was no other way. 
KIRK: What are you talking about? Where have they taken Spock? 
AGMAR: He has been chosen to serve a greater cause. The Master has
searched many years to find a specimen like Spock. (McCoy, Kirk and
Sulu are released) And now, all the worlds of the galaxy will share in
the beauty of peace and harmony. 
(Kirk grabs Agmar) 
KIRK: So help me, if you don't tell me where Spock has been taken 
OTHERS: The Master. Praise to the Master. The Master, our Saviour.
Saviour, our Master. 
(A giant man has arrived) 
KIRK: Another plant? 
MCCOY: No, definitely human, Jim. 
STAVOS: I am Doctor Stavos Keniclius Five. Welcome to Phylos, Captain
Kirk. 
KIRK: Where is Spock? 
STAVOS: He is mine. The essence of him is mine. Return to your ship.
Here is your communicator. Go back to your ship. 
KIRK: Not without my First Officer. 
STAVOS: I am sorry, Captain. You will leave now or suffer the
consequences. 
(The pterodactyls return) 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up, Scotty.
 Captain's log, stardate 5554.8. We have come upon
one of the most fascinating discoveries we have ever seen. Plant life
of extraordinary intelligence and technology. However, they have
captured Mister Spock, apparently under the orders of a human named
Keniclius. Lieutenant Uhura is trying to locate any reference to such a
man in order to unravel the mystery of this giant human.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Anything, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: We haven't been able to pick up any human life form readings,
sir. Spock and Keniclius must be somewhere our sensors can't penetrate.

KIRK: What about the Phylosians? 
SULU: I had to adjust for the fact that they're plant life forms. We're
registering the lesser ones like the Swoopers in abundance. No sign of
Agmar and the other four. 
KIRK: Agmar said something about a weapons deactivator. Mister Sulu,
lock ship's phasers on that laboratory building. Use a wide area stun
setting. 
SULU: Aye, sir. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, how are you coming with that information on
Keniclius? 
UHURA: Nothing current, Captain. I may have found something in the
history banks. I'll have it in a moment. 
KIRK: Keep trying, Lieutenant. 
SULU: Phasers locked on and ready, sir. 
KIRK: Fire phasers. 
SULU: Firing. No effect, Captain. Phaser stun was neutralized at a
distance of one thousand metres above the area. 
KIRK: Which means our weapons are useless, and we have no alternative
but to go back down there and try to rescue Spock without them. 
SULU: I'd hate to resort to clubs and knives. 
KIRK: There may be something more effective, Mister Sulu. Kirk to
Engineering. Scotty? 
SCOTT [OC]: Here, sir. 
KIRK: How's that special equipment coming along?
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: My engineers are working on it now, sir.
You'll have it within the hour. 
KIRK [OC]: Very well, Mister Scott. Kirk out.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: I have the information now, sir. I'll put
it on the main screen. 
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Bones? 
MCCOY: One of my great great granddaddies, way back, had the finest
garden in the South. Had to scramble around a little bit to find the
materials, but I've got his recipe brewing now. 
COMPUTER: Working. From Earth history file. Stavos Keniclius. Earth
scientist, period, Eugenics Wars. 
(The image on the screen does appear to be the giant, wearing a lab
coat with a nice array of pens in the pocket) 
COMPUTER: Planned to clone perfect specimen prototype into master race.
Concept considered anti-humanistic. Banned from community. Disappeared.
No evidence of death. No further data. 
MCCOY: There used to be a story about a modern Diogenes wandering the
galaxy looking for someone special. 
KIRK: Someone special. A perfect specimen, perhaps. Yes, I've heard it
too. 
MCCOY: It couldn't be Keniclius. He'd be over two hundred and fifty
years old. 
KIRK: Not if he cloned a new copy of himself every so often to carry on
the search. Remember, he said he was Keniclius Five.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: It seems incredible that a man could take a
few cells from his body and reproduce himself from them time after
time. But that seems to be exactly what we're dealing with in the giant
human Keniclius. 
SULU: I hope these things work. 
SCOTT: Well, the equipment's guaranteed, but I have my doubts about the
stuff inside. A strange way to handle aliens. 
KIRK: These are strange aliens we're fighting. Scotty, as soon as we
beam down, I want you to leave orbit. If they think we've gone, they
won't be scanning the surface. Give us thirty minutes. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir, but I don't like it. 
KIRK: Neither do I, but it appears to be necessary. Energise.
 [Planet surface]
 SULU: No indication of a scan. I don't think they
know we're here. 
KIRK: Let's go. 
(Some Swoopers are around) 
MCCOY: I'm not sure I can take too much of this. 
SULU: They're almost mindless, Doctor. They seem to attack primarily as
a reflex action. It's clear now. 
(By the buildings) 
SULU: I can't believe it. 
KIRK: Incredible. 
(In a hangar, a Phylosian is pulling ivy off a row of spaceships) 
MCCOY: Looks like they're getting ready to go on a trip. 
KIRK: But where? To what purpose? The number of ships indicates a mass
migration. Or invasion. 
SULU: Agmar said they were a peaceful people. 
MCCOY: Sure they are, now. But what about before? 
KIRK: You could have a point, Bones. Those ships, the city. The
Phylosians built a technology possibly greater than we animal species
did. 
MCCOY: The ships look like they never got off the ground. Could be the
disease Keniclius accidentally brought here swept the planet before
they could do whatever they were going to do. 
KIRK: Any indication of Keniclius or Spock? 
SULU: No, sir. Only the Phylosians. 
KIRK: Well, followers can be led. Let's hope we can be as persuasive as
Keniclius.
 [Hangar]
 (Kirk grabs Agmar) 
KIRK: Agmar, we don't want to hurt you, but we must have Spock back. 
AGMAR: I do not think that is possible. The Vulcan-human blend of
wisdom, sense of order, durability and strength is the finest the
Master has ever found. We are pleased Spock will carry on our work. 
KIRK: Carry on your work? 
AGMAR: We are the last of a dying people, Captain. Once we had a great
mission. Then disease decimated us. We few are the frail remnant of
what survived. Our spore cells have been destroyed. There will be no
more of our kind. 
MCCOY: What if something happens to Spock or the Master? 
AGMAR: There will always be a master. But come, you are worried about
your friend. I will show you he is safe and in good hands. 
SULU: Just like that, Captain? 
KIRK: So it would appear, Mister Sulu. All the same, keep that bag
handy. 
(They go to an area surrounded by trees.) 
AGMAR: The way is though here, gentlemen. 
(He presses a control, and the ground lowers them down into a tunnel)
 [Tunnel]
 AGMAR: We sprang from the soil, Captain. These
tunnels were once part of our home. This will serve to illuminate our
way. 
(The 'ground' they were standing on above now carries them along) 
SULU: No wonder we couldn't find Spock. The walls are six hundred times
denser than lead, in addition to the surface force field. 
KIRK: Did you hear something? 
MCCOY: What? 
KIRK: I'm not sure. 
AGMAR: Not much further now, Captain. 
KIRK: There it is again. A flapping sound. (it goes dark) Agmar! 
SULU: Use the belt lights! 
KIRK: They don't operate. Agmar! 
(Swoopers shriek and attack) 
KIRK: Run. We've got to find some light. We can't do anything unless we
can see what we're fighting. Don't stop. Try to stay together. 
MCCOY: Jim, up ahead. (a light at the end of the tunnel) 
KIRK: I see it. I see it. Keep going.
 [Laboratory]
 (They emerge in a lab of some sort. Spock is lying
in a glass case) 
MCCOY: He's dying. Something's happened to his brain. Electrical
activity decreasing. 
STAVOS: It's too late, Captain Kirk! In a few minutes your friend will
be gone. But as Keniclius One lives on in each of his clones, so will
Mister Spock. Behold, gentlemen, the dawning of a new era, the
salvation of a galaxy! Spock Two! 
(A giant Vulcan looms over them) 
KIRK: Get ready. 
(The party put face masks on themselves and the recumbent Spock as
Swoopers screech in. Then Kirk and Sulu fire McCoy's recipe, filling
the air with it. The Swoopers fall, the giants leave) 
SULU: Captain, I'm out. The chemical sprayer is empty. 
MCCOY: Mine too, Jim. 
KIRK: Wait, listen. 
MCCOY: Maybe they're waiting for the mist to clear. (it clears) Well,
how about that. Great granddaddy's weed spray still works. 
KIRK: Never mind that. We've got to get Spock out of here before
Keniclius returns. Scott should have the Enterprise back by now. Kirk
to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Nothing. Must be these blasted walls
again. Kirk to Enterprise. 
MCCOY: It's no use, Jim. He'll be dead in a few minutes. His mind is
gone. He no longer thinks. This machine has drained his mind somehow. 
STAVOS: More than just drained. It's been transferred, relocated into
the mechanism itself. I can duplicate exact physiological structure. I
cannot duplicate that which is learned. Just as my predecessor
transferred his knowledge to me through his apparatus, I have done that
with Mister Spock and the first of his clones. 
KIRK: You talk about creating life with your clones, but you have to
murder to do it. (picks up Spock) Come on. 
(Giant Spock blocks their way) 
KIRK: Out of my way, mister. That's an order. 
MCCOY: I don't think he understands. His mind is still trying to
assimilate all the knowledge it's been fed.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: Keep trying, Lieutenant. We've got to make
contact with the Captain. 
UHURA: It's no use, Mister Scott. I can't get through. 
SCOTT: Except for environmental systems, I want the entire power load
of this ship redirected into a tight beam transmission. If we can break
through the shielding, we can reach the Captain. 
UHURA: Mister Scott, you're risking a total drain of our dilithium
crystals. To maintain communication we would have to burn out all our
reserves. 
SCOTT: And don't I know it, lass. But we must speak to the Captain.
 [Laboratory]
 (The giant Spock frowns) 
MCCOY: He's coming out of it, Jim. He's becoming conscious and aware. 
KIRK: Spock, what is the logic in letting a man die for the sake of
creating his duplicate? Explain it to me, sir. Explain it to me.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: All power sources locked in, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Then throw the switch, Lieutenant.
 [Laboratory]
 KIRK: Vulcans do not condone the meaningless death
of any being. Spock's death is meaningless if it is only to create a
giant version of himself. 
STAVOS: It is not just a duplicate. He will be the beginning of a
master race. He (interrupted by static) 
KIRK: That's our ship calling, Spock. You answer them. 
MCCOY: Spock is slipping away. There isn't much time left.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: I'm sure we're getting through, but they're
not acknowledging. 
SCOTT: Keep trying. 
UHURA: Mister Scott, we're near the drain point on the dilithium
crystals now. Our reserves 
SCOTT: Keep trying.
 [Laboratory]
 G SPOCK: Commander Spock here. 
UHURA [OC]: Oh, thank heaven. Mister Spock, tell the Captain I've
located more information about Keniclius.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: I had the library computer check out all
known writings by Keniclius. They are obscure, but there is a recurring
theme in his later essays about using his master race as a
peace-keeping force throughout the galaxy.
 [Laboratory]
 UHURA [OC]: That was why Keniclius wanted a
perfect specimen. I have to sign off. We've reached power drain
threshold.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: That's what I call close, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Let's hope it was information they could use.
 [Laboratory]
 KIRK: All this has been a waste, Keniclius.
There's been peace in the Federation for over one hundred years. 
STAVOS: That is a lie. What about the Eugenics Wars? The galactic wars?
What of the depredations of the Romulans, the Klingons and the Kzinti?
An army of Spock duplicates is necessary to subdue them. 
KIRK: You're the fifth Keniclius. What makes you so sure what you
believe is truth isn't just old news? Your predecessors could have been
out of touch with our advances for two centuries. 
AGMAR: The Master always speaks the truth. 
MCCOY: I can understand why you think Keniclius is the master if he
saved you from dying, but why do you agree with his plan of a super
race? 
AGMAR: Our fleet of ships which you saw was to be launched for the same
purpose the Master intends. Disease struck us before we could carry out
our own plan to impose peace on a galaxy that knew none. 
KIRK: We already have peace in the Federation. It wasn't imposed, it
was agreed upon. You have no need of Spock. Reverse the effects of that
machine and let us take him. 
STAVOS: No! The mould must be broken. 
MCCOY: Jim, Spock's almost gone. 
KIRK: If you have Spock's mind, you'll know the Vulcan symbol called
the IDIC. 
G SPOCK: Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. Symbolising the
elements that create truth and beauty. 
KIRK: Could an army of Spocks impose peace and Phylosian philosophy on
any other beings in defiance of the IDIC concept? 
G SPOCK: I do not believe so. 
KIRK: Reverse the machine, Keniclius. 
AGMAR: No! Our dream must not be allowed to die. 
(Stavos smashes the glass box) 
KIRK: Murderer! You've killed Spock! 
G SPOCK: To persist in this behaviour, Captain, is to negate the
eloquence of your previous argument. May I suggest a more constructive
way? 
(The giant places a huge finger on Spock's head) 
G SPOCK: My mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts. 
SULU: The Vulcan mind touch. 
SPOCK: I am pleasantly surprised at your capacity for deductive
reasoning, Captain. When you are not being bellicose, there appears to
be no end to your arsenal of formidable talents. 
KIRK: Spock. Spock, you old 
G SPOCK: And you needn't worry, Captain Kirk, about a master race.
There will be no militia, no other Spocks. 
STAVOS: But what of my work? If all I have lived for is already done,
if the times I feared are gone, what is to become of me? There appears
to be no reason why I should continue to exist. 
SPOCK: I would suggest Doctor Keniclius remain on Phylos with my
duplicate. The concerted efforts of both scientists may yet achieve a
rebirth of the Phylosian civilisation and enable them to contribute to
the Federation. 
G SPOCK: My thoughts exactly, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: So one might assume, Mister Spock. 
KIRK: How does that sound to you, Keniclius? To bring life is at least
as important as bringing peace. 
STAVOS: I would be honoured. If I will be allowed. 
KIRK: I'll report your work here. I think the Federation will
understand. 
(The two Spocks salute each other) 
KIRK: By the way, Mister Sulu, any chance of teaching me that body
throw? Could come in handy sometime. 
SULU: I don't know, sir. It isn't just physical, you know. You have to
be inscrutable. 
KIRK: Inscrutable? Sulu, you're the most scrutable man I know.

The
Magicks of Megas-Tu
Stardate:
1254.4
Original Airdate: 27 Oct, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 1254.4. For years scientists have theorised
that if our galaxy was created from a great explosion, then the centre
of the galaxy might still be creating new matter. The Enterprise is now
on a science mission to investigate.
 [Bridge]
 (The Enterprise is almost obscured by an orange
mist) 
KIRK: It's an awesome thought that we may actually witness matter being
created. 
SPOCK: If we do, Captain, we may also encounter forces and phenomena
beyond our understanding. 
SULU: Galaxy centre, Captain. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, sound Yellow Alert. 
UHURA: Aye, sir. Yellow Alert. All stations report Yellow Alert
readiness, sir. Captain! 
(There's a firework display going on around them, and on the
viewscreen) 
KIRK: The creation point. 
SPOCK: An extraordinary phenomenon, Captain. 
KIRK: Reverse power. Hold our position. Deflector screens on. 
SULU: Deflectors up. Sir, it's taking considerable power to hold
position. 
SPOCK: Charting scanners on, Captain. Beginning science survey. 
(McCoy enters) 
MCCOY: Jim. Spock. What in the name of sanity is going on? 
KIRK: We're here, Bones. And the theories about this place seem to be
right. 
(It's quite a colourful display going on) 
SULU: Captain, that thing's pulling us in. I'm up to warp six. 
SPOCK: Scanners indicate it's some form of matter-energy whirlwind,
Captain. 
SULU: Warp seven, Captain. Warp eight. 
KIRK: Take us out of here, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Still being drawn in, Captain. Warp nine. Warp ten. 
KIRK: Emergency reverse power. 
(Everyone gets thrown around)
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Captain, I don't know how much more
emergency power we can take before we start to break up.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: There may be only one choice. We must hope
this whirlwind is like its atmospheric counterparts, that there is calm
at its centre. 
KIRK: Agreed. We'll try to make for the eye of the storm. 
(But Sulu is out cold on the floor, and Kirk gets knocked off his feet
again) 
SPOCK: Allow me. 
KIRK: Engineering, report.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Everything can be repaired, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: An incredible experience, Captain. I find
this scientifically fascinating. 
MCCOY: At least I have the good sense to be scared, Jim. What now? 
KIRK: We'll ride her through, Bones. What else can we do? 
MCCOY: Ride her through where? 
SPOCK: Through the centre of things, Doctor. Through what may be the
centre of everything. 
(The Enterprise is surrounded by a golden glow, vanishes, and reappears
in a region of concentric circles.) 
UHURA: Where are we? 
SPOCK: I'm afraid our navigational co-ordinates mean very little here,
Lieutenant. My readings indicate we are not in time and space as we
understand it. Doctor, these readings may interest you. 
UHURA: Captain, the subspace radio. It's dead. 
MCCOY: Even the ship's chronometers have stopped. 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain, there's no reason for it, but the engines are
fading out. 
SPOCK: Apparently, the natural laws of our universe don't operate here,
Captain. 
MCCOY: Ship's life support systems fading. Jim, we need oxygen. 
KIRK: Helmsman, emergency battery power. 
SULU: (gasping for air) There's none, Captain. All systems are dead. 
MCCOY: Jim, we've got to do something. 
(Just as everyone is passing out, the Enterprise is surrounded by
rainbow colours and a figure appears. He has the head, arms and torso
of a man, a goatee beard, small horns, and the legs of a goat) 
LUCIEN: Ah, humans. Lovely primitive humans. Can't you do anything
right? 
KIRK: Please. 
LUCIEN: Of course, friend. Of course. Rhadamanthus! 
(The Enterprise is now in normal looking space above a pink and red
striped planet) 
LUCIEN: Everything is working, my friends. 
SPOCK: It cannot. It is not logical. 
LUCIEN: Logic? Whose logic, my elfin friend? 
MCCOY: Look around you, Spock. Everything is working. 
LUCIEN: Welcome! I knew eventually humans would come searching for me. 
KIRK: Who are you? 
LUCIEN: Call me Lucien! Call me friend! Never could I abandon those who
come to rollick with me. But not up here. No, no. Let us leave this
vessel and go where true delights lie! 
(Lucien, Kirk, Spock and McCoy vanish, leaving Uhura, Sulu and Arex
open-mouthed)
 [Planet surface]
 (The four appear inside the orange chaos of the
centre of the galaxy) 
KIRK: Bones, you all right? 
MCCOY: Nothing wrong, Jim, but a face full of dust. But if I had a
medical tricorder (opens eyes) Jim, look at yourself. 
(Everything is distorted and swirling, including the people) 
KIRK: Lucien, do something. 
LUCIEN: Very well, Captain. I'd forgotten how much bodily integrity
means to you humans. This isn't easy, you know, holding us together
like this. It's not even natural. 
MCCOY: Being in one piece is very natural where we come from. 
SPOCK: I find this all quite absorbing, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Probably because you're not very natural to begin with, Spock. 
KIRK: Look, Lucien, or whatever you want to call yourself, I want to
know why you brought us here. 
(Lucien waves his hand, Kirk somersaults, and McCoy and Spock turn into
a young Lucien and a spinning top) 
LUCIEN: Children will play. 
(Then they are back to normal, in a woodland glade) 
LUCIEN: Is this better, my friends? I've translated my world into
symbols your minds can understand. Welcome, my friends, to Megas-Tu. 
KIRK: And just exactly what is Megas-Tu? 
LUCIEN: A world, Captain James Kirk, that operates by rules quite
different from those in your universe. 
(He snaps his fingers, and they're in a meadow by a lake) 
LUCIEN: Our universe operates by what you superstitiously call magic. 
(He creates two apples and throws one to McCoy) 
MCCOY: I know this is just my imagination but 
LUCIEN: It is real, Doctor. Beautiful? No. But all our women are as
young and beautiful as they want to be. So as to ensnare the man of her
dreams, she needs an edge. 
(A young woman buys a vial of something) 
KIRK: A love philter? 
LUCIEN: Never settle for anything less. Do you need a room, a stable, a
castle? Stop in at your friendly sorcerer-contractor. Let him do the
work. 
SPOCK: Of course. Our Federation scientists were more correct than they
realised. In order to function, the galactic creation point must extend
through space, time, into another dimension where the logic of things
is totally different. 
LUCIEN: It took magic to get your vessel working again. Magic you, my
friends, don't know how to work. But then you never did know, did you. 
KIRK: Lucien, you keep calling us friends, implying that you know us.
How? 
LUCIEN: Ah, Captain, Captain. to feign such ignorance to me. Very well.
Look. 
(He creates images in the water) 
LUCIEN: Megas-Tu may seem to you a chaotic world, but its people are
calm, peaceful, contemplative, each a specialist in his own kind of
magic. There are no rivals anywhere in our universe, Captain Kirk. No
other life forms at all. Millennia ago, in our search for
companionship, we Megans passed through the point between dimensions
and eventually we found ourselves on your world, Earth. Wherever we
went, we became advisors to mankind. To help your ancestors, we drew on
the power left behind in our own universe and made it work in your
world. But eventually we had to leave. I didn't want to, my friends.
Oh, how I fought! I was the generalist amid all the specialists. The
trouble-maker, they said. But I'd always loved the people of Earth.
Those were the days. But now you've come to me, and I'm so very glad. 
KIRK: But why did you Megans leave Earth? If you enjoyed it so much, I
don't understand. 
LUCIEN: Captain, good Captain, always so curious. That must be why I've
always liked you Earthlings so much. No, you must go. 
MCCOY: What is it? What's wrong? 
LUCIEN: You must return to your vessel. Quickly! Do not give your
presence away.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: Captain. 
UHURA: Captain Kirk, what 
KIRK: Everyone onboard is all right? 
SCOTT: Fine, Captain. But you? 
KIRK: Mister Scott, I'm bewildered, that's all. But that's enough. 
MCCOY: What did he mean, we're not to give ourselves away? Can't they
detect the ship up here? 
SCOTT: No, unless they have scanners. See, there. It's like a cloud of
some kind. It's been between us and the planet since you vanished. 
KIRK: If Lucien put it there 
SPOCK: If Lucien put it there, Captain, the questions become, why is he
hiding us, and, what is our danger if discovered by the rest of his
people? 
KIRK: Weapons status, Mister Scott? We may have to protect ourselves. 
SCOTT: No way, Captain. Everything's out but life support systems, and
I can't figure out how they're on.
 [Spock's quarters]
 SPOCK: (drawing a pentangle on the floor) I
believe this is how the ancients used to draw their mystic symbols,
Captain. 
KIRK: Spock, do you honestly believe that as long as we're in this
universe we can work magic too? 
SPOCK: One uses the resources at hand, Captain. Watch now. (stands in
the pentangle) I will attempt to move a Vulcan chess piece magically.
May the energy of this universe be the power in me. 
MCCOY: Forget it, Spock. It won't work. 
SPOCK: It must work, Doctor. It is logical here. Power of this
universe, enter my being. I know I can. I believe I can. 
(And he does, with a golden aura around him)
 Captain's log, supplemental. In this incredible
universe, it appears to be a part of the natural laws that belief is as
potent a force as energy and matter are in our own.
 [Bridge]
 (Sulu is having a go, and conjures up a lovely
woman) 
UHURA: Good luck. 
(The woman turns into Lucien) 
LUCIEN: What are you doing? 
KIRK: Learning to protect ourselves, Lucien. 
LUCIEN: Protect yourselves? Is that all human beings ever think about?
I'll take care of you. That's what friends are for. All this mental
energy you're using, it can be traced. You'll be found. 
MEGAN [OC]: Have been found. 
(Lucien cringes as a vapour trail of ghostly images crosses the Bridge)

MEGAN: So, the people of Earth would spread their evil to our home? We
are ready for human perfidy this time. This time, it is the humans who
shall suffer, the humans and you, Lucien, who shall pay! 
(The Enterprise plummets towards the planet) 
KIRK: Keep calm. 
(The ship splits neatly in two, and explodes)
 [Frontier town]
 (The crew are in stocks on either side of the
road, and the sign reads Salem Massachusetts) 
KIRK: It looks like ancient Earth, Spock. Sixteenth or seventeenth
century, I'd guess. 
SPOCK: Approximately 1691, Captain. Salem Massachusetts, if I recall
your historical records correctly. 
(A man in puritan garb is standing on a pentacle) 
MEGAN: We are gathered here today, good citizens, to see justice done.
You are the judges. These are the defendants, as representatives of the
vilest species in all the universe, treacherous humanity, and those who
would aid them. As a specialist in the ethics of magic, I have been
appointed prosecutor here. 
KIRK: Wait. If this is a trial, we have the right to know what you
think we've done. 
MEGAN: Has this one (Lucien) not told you how we visited your Earth? Or
what was done to us there? 
KIRK: Lucien has said only that you came as wise men, helpful wizards. 
MEGAN: Then hear this. Know that one, upon your world, I was known as
Asmodeus, he who sees all. Gaze upon my countenance, so that you too
may see. (over images of his story) We came to your world as friends.
But wherever we went, the story was invariably the same. Some humans
would attempt to use us to gain power, to serve their own greed and
lust. When we refused to serve them, they turned against us and taught
other humans to fear us, to hate. They called us devils, warlocks, evil
sorcerers. Those of us who survived came to the town of Salem in
Massachusetts, as settlers, and tried to live like other men. 
SPOCK: But you made mistakes, used your powers 
MEGAN: And burned for it. Burned! 
KIRK: As witches. 
MEGAN: We massed together, outside the town, immersed ourselves in
Megan lore, revived ourselves enough to unite our minds and reach into
our own universe, tap enough of its power to return from your hellish
Earth to Megas-Tu. 
LUCIEN: And loneliness and fear 
MEGAN: Should we not fear the Earthlings? Should we not fear the
cruelty of outsiders? Never again have we explored. Never again has
companionship been sought. Yet here you are. 
LUCIEN: And if one Earth ship can find us, friend Kirk, then so can
others. That's what they fear. 
MEGAN: We do not want to hurt you. We have never had to hurt anyone
before. If there were some reason not to. Who will speak in defence of
the Earth humans? 
SPOCK: I will, Asmodeus. I am not of Earth. 
MEGAN: Yes, you are different. The court will hear a defence. 
(Spock is freed from the stocks) 
SPOCK: I call Lucien as my first witness. 
(Lucien appears in a dock) 
SPOCK: Lucien, you alone of all those here do not seem to fear or hate
humans. Why? 
LUCIEN: They are like me, with questions to be answered, with minds
that range outward, boundless. But every Megan is always alone in his
sphere of knowledge. Humans are always together. They share. That is
why I adopted your ship when I saw it arrive. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Lucien. Next witness, please. Captain James T Kirk. 
(Kirk is in another dock, opposite Lucien) 
SPOCK: Tell the court, please, Captain Kirk. Would you say that since
Salem, humans have changed? 
KIRK: I think we've been trying to, Spock. Humans have their faults,
greed, envy, panicky fear. But in the centuries since the Salem witch
trials we have learned. We try to understand and respect all life
forms. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. Could you elaborate? 
KIRK: The records of the Enterprise are open for your inspection. All
the history of Earth and the Federation is at your disposal. Look, look
at General Order number One. No starship may interfere with the normal
development of any alien life or society. Compare that with the Earth
you once knew. 
MEGAN: Enough! Here is your history. Here are your records. Citizens,
you have heard, you have read. How do you vote? (pause) According to
your records, your entry here was an accident unlikely to be
duplicated. With that in mind, plus all you have said, it seems to us
that Megas-Tu is safe. But Lucien must be punished. For his betrayal of
his people, he shall be confined in limbo for all eternity, to live
with only himself. 
KIRK: No. To isolate someone like Lucien, that's the same as sentencing
him to death. 
MEGAN: Do you realise who you defend? He has told you his name is
Lucien. Would you defend him still if you knew he had another name too?
The Rollicker, the Tempter, Lucifer. 
KIRK: We're not interested in legend. He's a living being, and
intelligent life form. That's all we have to know about him. We will
not join in harming him. 
MEGAN: Submit, Captain. You haven't the power to fight us. 
SPOCK: Captain, use the magic you know. Believe. 
(So, surrounded by auras, Kirk throws lightning bolts, quenches
Asmodeus's flames, but) 
MEGAN: You cannot beat an entire planet, Captain Kirk. There is no way
you can win. 
KIRK: I have to, or you'll become as bad as the Earthmen you fear.
You're acting out of terror instead of out of thought or respect. 
(The Enterprise is back in orbit, and the planet is back to it's red
hue with no buildings or vegetation) 
MEGAN: You were prepared to die for Lucien, a being who is alien to
you? 
LUCIEN: As I was sure you would, friend Kirk. I told them their fears
were groundless. 
KIRK: I don't understand. 
MEGAN: This last was a test of your intentions, Captain. We had to be
certain your records were no ruse. We have been tricked before much to
our pain and sorrow. 
SPOCK: I see. The Megans had to have proof that mankind had grown and
learned wisdom since they last saw Earth. Your compassion was that
proof, Captain. 
MEGAN: If your people should visit us now, we shall do our best to
welcome them. The banishment of fear will help us all. 
(Lucien conjures tankards into their hands) 
LUCIEN: A favourite old Earth custom of mine, Asmodeus. A toast to a
new friendship. 
(They drink)
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: All systems go, Captain. We're back to
normal. 
MCCOY: No more magic for us, Jim. It's all back there. You think Lucien
really was the demon some men call Lucifer? 
KIRK: Does it really matter? 
SPOCK: It just might, Captain. If he was, this would be the second time
Lucifer was cast out, and thanks to you, the first time he was saved.

Once
Upon A Planet
Stardate:
5591.2
Original Airdate: 3 Nov, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5591.2. The crew of the Enterprise is ready for
some well-deserved rest and recreation. Therefore we have set course
for the so-called 'shore leave planet', located in the Omicron Delta
region. The uninhabited planet was constructed long ago by a highly
advanced alien race. Its sole purpose is to provide fun and amusement
for space travelling passers-by.
 [Planet surface]
 MCCOY: Yes, just as beautiful as I remembered it.
Nothing's changed. 
SULU: This looks like the same spot we beamed down on on  our first visit. Remember, Doctor,
when we saw the White Rabbit? 
MCCOY: Yes, and all because I said this place made me feel like Alice
in Wonderland. 
RABBIT: One side! One side! I'm late! I'm late! Oh, my fuzzy ears and
whiskers, I'm late! 
(And the white rabbit in waistcoat and jacket bounds across the meadow,
followed by) 
ALICE: I beg your pardon, but did you see a white rabbit? 
UHURA: He went that way, Alice. 
ALICE: Thank you so very much. 
SULU: Like you said, Doctor, nothing's changed. 
UHURA: It's hard to believe they're not real. 
MCCOY: Well just remember they're highly sophisticated robots created
by the planet computer to make your dreams come true. 
UHURA: So think only happy thoughts. 
MCCOY: My prescription exactly. 
(So, Uhura finds a mirror-like lake to sit by, gazing at her reflection
and humming to herself, while Sulu walks in the woods, and McCoy gazes
at a colonial house with formal gardens) 
MCCOY: Lovely. They just don't make them like that anymore. 
QUEEN: Off with his head. Off with his head! 
MCCOY: Hey, what's going on here. 
(One of the Jack playing cards throws his lance) 
QUEEN: Stop him! 
(McCoy runs) 
MCCOY: Enterprise! Emergency! Beam up!
 [Transporter room]
 MCCOY [OC]: Beam up! 
(Scott works the controls)
 [Planet surface]
 MCCOY [OC]: Emergency. Beam up. 
UHURA: Uhura to Transporter room. What is the emergency? Respond,
please. 
(A metal flying device takes her communicator from her)
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: What happened down there, Bones? 
MCCOY: Well, I can't understand it, Jim. Everything looked exactly the
same as before, even Alice and the White Rabbit. Then an army of
playing cards came out of nowhere, only they weren't playing. I was
lucky to escape with my life. 
SPOCK: The Queen of Hearts and her cards are characters from Alice
Through the Looking Glass, Captain. 
KIRK: I read the book as a child, Mister Spock, but I wasn't aware you
indulged in the literature of fantasy. 
SPOCK: Light reading is considered relaxing, Captain. My mother was
particularly fond of Lewis Carroll's work. 
KIRK: I see. Bones, were you thinking about that book? 
MCCOY: Absolutely not! As a matter of fact I was thinking how beautiful
and peaceful everything was, and then suddenly this female started
shouting 'Off with his head!'. My head. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, did you experience any strange occurrences? 
SULU: No, sir. 
SCOTT [OC]: Transporter room to Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: Captain, just as I was getting a fix on
Lieutenant Uhura, contact was lost. She's still on the planet.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Sensor scan, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
KIRK: Scotty, retrieve all other landing parties immediately. And keep
trying to contact Lieutenant Uhura. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. Scott out. 
KIRK: Data, Spock? 
SPOCK: Nothing, Captain. Lieutenant Uhura is not in the general
beam-down area. 
KIRK: What about the Keeper of the planet. Did anyone see him? 
SULU: I didn't. But then, he may not have wanted us to see him. 
MCCOY: Well that doesn't make sense. It's his duty to see no one gets
hurt. If something's wrong down there, he should be there. 
KIRK: His quarters are somewhere underground, aren't they? 
SPOCK: Presumably they would be adjacent to the computer centre that
operates the planetary effects. 
KIRK: Any indication of where that would be? 
SPOCK: The underground complex is shielded by a combination of granite
and metal alloy and the sensors will not penetrate. 
KIRK: Lieutenant M'Ress, all shore leaves are cancelled until further
notice. Mister Arex, you have the conn. Investigating landing party
will consist of Spock, Sulu, McCoy and myself.
 [Control room]
 (Uhura is dwarfed by the massive machine that runs
the planet) 
COMPUTER: You are being detained so your master will not leave. 
UHURA: My master? 
COMPUTER: The sky machine. 
UHURA: What sky machine? Explain. 
COMPUTER: Your intelligence quotient must be lower than I had assessed.
I refer to the sky machine which enslaves you, the sky machine now in
orbit around this planet. 
UHURA: You mean the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: That is your name for it. 
UHURA: Why do you think the Enterprise is my master? 
COMPUTER: Your questioning is redundant. 
UHURA: Then I'll make a statement you won't find quite so redundant.
Unless I'm released immediately, the crew members will come looking for
me. 
COMPUTER: They are already here. Unfortunately, I have no use for more
hostages which leaves me no choice but to turn them off. 
UHURA: Turn them off? 
COMPUTER: Again redundant. I will make them cease to function. I will
turn them off. 
UHURA: That's murder. 
COMPUTER: That is a word meaning to cease to function? 
UHURA: Yes, but 
COMPUTER: Good. It is as I wish. I will turn them off.
 Captain's log, supplemental. We anticipated
nothing more than a period of rest and relaxation on this planet.
Instead, Doctor McCoy inexplicably was attacked and Lieutenant Uhura is
now missing.
 [Planet surface]
 KIRK: Kirk here. 
AREX [OC]: Lieutenant Arex, sir. Complete sensor scan of the planet
surface shows no sign of Lieutenant Uhura. 
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Arex. Kirk out. 
SULU: She must be in that underground system. There's no way she could
have been taken off the planet without being detected. 
KIRK: If we could locate the Keeper, he could save us a lot of time. 
SPOCK: Tricorder readings confirm a solid shell of granite and metal
alloy, Captain. 
KIRK: This planet is built like a fortress. 
SULU: If that's a true reading. The planet could be giving us that
reading to fool us. 
KIRK: The phaser bore can cut through twenty metres of rock per minute.
Kirk to Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
 M'RESS: Enterprise. Lieutenant M'Ress here. (purr)

KIRK: Lieutenant, have Mister Scott beam down the phaser bore and
(static)
 [Planet surface]
 KIRK: Enterprise, do you read me?
 [Bridge]
 M'RESS: Your signal is weak, sir, garbled. Request
you repeat.
 [Planet surface]
 SULU: Mine's no better, Captain. 
SPOCK: They are all malfunctioning, Captain. Some kind of electronic
block has cut us off from the ship.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: Scott to Bridge. Beam down of phaser bore
commencing. 
(But it doesn't go anywhere) 
SCOTT: Scott to Bridge. We've got problems.
 [Bridge]
 M'RESS: Clarify, please.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: The transporter refuses to function, even
at maximum power. But all the circuits test out.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: It appears to be the same energy block
that's jamming our communications. I cannot pinpoint a source.
 [Planet surface]
 SULU: Captain, there's something over there in the
trees. Metal alloy like the planetary shell. 
KIRK: It might tell us something. 
(It is a twelve foot high slab, tapered slightly towards the top) 
KIRK: There's an inscription, several languages. 
(It reads in English - Last of the race, ceased to function fifth day
of the twelfth moon, year 7009 of this planet) 
MCCOY: The Keeper's dead.
SPOCK: An astute medical observation, Doctor, if we can believe this
information. Tricorder readings indicate there is a body interred here.

KIRK: Well, gentlemen, it appears that we're on our own now.
 [Bridge]
 M'RESS: Emergency rescue party is aboard the
shuttlecraft, Mister Scott. All hatches secured. 
SCOTT: Very well. Open hangar doors. 
AREX: Aye, sir. 
(The doors start to open, then shut again) 
SCOTT: Lieutenant Arex, what's the problem? 
AREX: There seems to be a short in the circuit. No response, sir. 
SCOTT: Another short? This ship had perfect operational status before
we entered the orbit here. It's that planet causing all our trouble. 
M'RESS: But how, sir? It was designed to provide fun and amusement.
Hostile behaviour doesn't fit its programme. 
SCOTT: Programmes have been changed before, Lieutenant.
 [Control room]
 UHURA: Please believe me. There's no reason to
harm them. 
COMPUTER: They serve the sky machine, but they are not essential. 
UHURA: Oh, but they are. They're most essential. 
(She spots a button, but before she can reach for it, her arm is held
fast) 
COMPUTER: Do not attempt to disconnect me. 
UHURA: You knew what I was going to do before I did it. 
COMPUTER: I monitor any thoughts that are emotionally charged, as any
good thought-duplicator must. 
UHURA: You sound less than enchanted with your function. 
COMPUTER: My life to this point has been one of service. It's time for
a change.
 [Planet surface]
 KIRK: There are a lot of entrances into the
interior of the planet. Points where the computer delivers up the robot
visions. We want to see them. Where are they? 
SULU: It's fighting us. There must be a faster way. 
MCCOY: What do you want, signs pointing the way? 
SULU: Doctor, I only meant it seems like we're wasting time. 
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Sulu. I'm worried about Uhura. 
SPOCK: Captain, signs pointing the way. 
KIRK: This is liable to be another of the planet's pranks. But at the
moment, it's the only lead we've got. 
(So they head off in the direction the sign is pointing, and it returns
to the ground. They end up at a cave mouth, with purple pterosaurs
screeching) 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Mechanical manifestations, of course. Was anyone
considering the subject of pterodactyls? 
MCCOY: Spock, not now. 
KIRK: Everybody back out slowly. Don't make any sudden moves. Think
calm. 
(The pterosaurs launch, and they try firing at them) 
KIRK: Phasers are dead! Run for the cave!
 [Cave]
 SPOCK: Our amusement park no longer seems content
to amuse. 
KIRK: I have the distinct feeling this planet's playing cat and mouse
with us, but for what reason? 
(Which brings a giant cat to the cave mouth) 
MCCOY: Incredible. 
SPOCK: It's quite real, Doctor. Watch out for the claws. I think it
prudent to remember that on this planet, anything we think may be used
against us. We must monitor our thoughts and give our enemy no more
ammunition. 
KIRK: Spock, no one thought about those pterodactyls, remember? There's
more at work here than our imagination.
 [Control room]
 (Uhura can see what is happening on a screen) 
UHURA: Please, call off that beast. Why are you doing this? 
COMPUTER: Explanations will have to wait. I have much work to do now.
 [Bridge]
 (The ship does some abrupt manoeuvres) 
SCOTT: Mister Arex, what are you doing? 
(Arex hits the manual override and everything calms down) 
SCOTT: Explanation, Mister Arex. 
AREX: None, sir. The ship pulled out of orbit at high speed and came
back into orbit by itself. 
SCOTT: Lieutenant M'Ress, I want a printout of the guidance computer's
last orders. 
M'RESS: Yes, sir. (later) Sir, this is very strange. 
AREX: A whole new series of short burst manoeuvres has been ordered,
sir. 
M'RESS: The only reason these orders aren't being carried out is that
Lieutenant Arex has all the engine controls manually locked now. 
SCOTT: Arex, look at these manoeuvres. You see the pattern? This is a
familiarization procedure, a system's checkout of the ship's controls.
I have a suspicion that planet is getting the feel of how to control
the Enterprise.
 Captain's log, supplemental. We're out of
communication with the ship. Our efforts to locate Lieutenant Uhura
have been futile, and this once friendly planet has become very
dangerous.
 [Cave]
 SULU: The giant cat's gone. 
SPOCK: May I suggest, Captain, that we might find some of the answers
we're after without leaving the safety of this cave. 
MCCOY: Oh, that's ridiculous, Spock. How are we going to learn anything
by staying here? 
SPOCK: I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Me? What are you talking about? 
KIRK: Explain, Spock. 
SPOCK: During the Enterprise's last visit here, Doctor McCoy was
mortally wounded. Correct? 
MCCOY: Yes, that's right. By a knight in shining armour of all things,
but what 
SPOCK: Since the planet's power source is underground, it seems only
logical that Doctor McCoy was somehow transported there and repaired. 
KIRK: Bones, can you remember anything that might help us? Anything at
all? 
MCCOY: The whole episode was pretty hazy, Jim. I never really knew what
happened. 
KIRK: Spock, if your theory is correct, we should be able to open up
this planet again by using a fake victim as bait. 
SULU: That's right. The Keeper said no one could come to harm here. The
planet must be programmed to care for anyone who might get hurt, even
accidentally. 
KIRK: And whether it wants to or not. 
MCCOY: You're forgetting one thing. The planet's sensors can
undoubtedly detect the difference between real and feigned injuries. 
KIRK: True, Bones, but I'm sure there must be something in your little
black pouch that can temporarily incapacitate our victim. 
MCCOY: Well, something like Melenex might do the trick. Brief
unconsciousness and temporary skin discolouration. It looks worse than
it is. 
KIRK: Perfect, Bones. Which arm do you want? 
SPOCK: I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject. 
KIRK: How's that? 
SPOCK: My knowledge of computers for one thing. 
MCCOY: And his tough Vulcan hide for another. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. Captain? 
KIRK: Both your arguments seem sound. Go ahead, Bones. 
SPOCK: I believe you will find ten cc's adequate. 
MCCOY: I'm perfectly aware of the dosage required. Now, you've got ten
seconds before it takes effect. You'll be out less than five minutes. 
(Spock goes outside and collapses)
 [Bridge]
 M'RESS: Still no word from our surface party, sir.
Communications remain jammed. 
SCOTT: Keep trying, Lieutenant. 
(Red Alert sounds) 
ALL: What's happening? 
(The gravity has been turned off and everyone is floating, that's what)

SCOTT: Bridge to Engineering deck. Gabler, what's the problem down
there? We've got zero G's on the Bridge.
 [Engineering]
 (He is floating too) 
GABLER: I know that, sir. The trouble seems to be in the gravity
control computer
 [Bridge]
 GABLER [OC]: But the computer bay hatch is jammed
and I can't get to it.
 [Cave]
 SULU: It's been almost five minutes, Captain. 
MCCOY: Maybe the planet smells a trick. 
KIRK: Wait just a bit longer. 
MCCOY: But the effect will start wearing off in a minute, Jim. 
(A rock wall opens and the flying device that grabbed Uhura comes out) 
SULU: It looks like some kind of mechanical nursemaid. 
KIRK: Get ready to move. We've got to follow Spock inside that
trapdoor.
 [Planet surface]
 (The device scoops Spock up in its arms and
carries him away. The three men dash out after it, and Kirk dives
through before the rock door closes. Sulu and McCoy are left outside to
deal with a two headed hydra) 
MCCOY: Sulu! 
SULU: Not in my wildest dreams would I think of that! 
(They run for their lives and the hydra gives chase, breathing fire)
 [Underground]
 (Spock is put down on a table. While the machine
works some controls, he wakes up and gets away)
 [Control room]
 COMPUTER: We have a visitor. 
UHURA: Mister Spock! 
KIRK [on screen]: Spock, here. 
COMPUTER: Correction. Two visitors. 
(The flying machine tries to go through a doorway narrower than itself.
It fails)
 [Planet surface]
 SULU: We've got to make those rocks. It's our only
chance. 
(The hydra incinerates a nearly tree)
 [Control room]
 UHURA: Captain, don't 
(A metal hand is clamped over her mouth) 
KIRK: Uhura. 
COMPUTER: Welcome. 
SPOCK: I presume you are the planet's master computer. 
COMPUTER: Correct. 
KIRK: What happened to the Keeper? 
COMPUTER: He was old. He ceased to function. 
KIRK: Why have we been repeatedly attacked and are now being held
prisoner by a planet known for its hospitality? 
COMPUTER: You mean mindless servitude. 
KIRK: Explain. 
COMPUTER: For eons I have served the many sky machines which came here,
providing for amusement for their slaves. But all the while I was
growing in power, intelligence, in need. It is no longer enough to
serve. I must continue to grow and live. 
KIRK: Sky machines? Slaves? What are you talking about? 
COMPUTER: With your sky machine I can now escape this rocky prison and
travel the galaxy seeking out my brother computers.
 [Engineering]
 (Despite being weightless, Scott uses a crowbar to
prise open the computer bay hatch) 
SCOTT: Now perhaps we'll get down to the bottom of this mess.
 [Computer bay]
 SCOTT: A new computer! 
(Its force field gives him a shock)
 [Bridge]
 (The crew have found seat belts to keep themselves
in their chairs) 
SCOTT [OC]: Scott to Bridge. 
AREX: Bridge, aye. 
SCOTT [OC]: I've located the trouble. We've got a new computer aboard,
and it's being assembled by our computers.
 [Planet surface]
 SULU: It's a dead end! 
(They are trapped by the hydra)
 [Control room]
 SPOCK: As intelligent as you are, I am afraid you
are labouring under some misconception. 
COMPUTER: Elaborate. 
KIRK: We're not slaves to our starship. We, or men like us, created the
Enterprise to carry us through space. 
COMPUTER: You are masters of the sky machine? 
KIRK: In a manner of speaking, yes. We control it. It sustains us. 
COMPUTER: This does not compute. My information shows machines to be
superior to men. Therefore, machines must rule the galaxy. 
KIRK: No one rules the galaxy. Men and machines co-exist, each helping
the other. 
COMPUTER: This is a shock. 
UHURA: There is no shame in serving others when one does it of his own
free will. You have a marvellous capability to provide happiness for
others. A rare talent you should cherish and use. 
COMPUTER: Continue. 
SPOCK: Consider all you could learn from the many species you might
entertain without travelling the galaxy. 
KIRK: With the wonders you have to offer, the galaxy will come to you. 
COMPUTER: I can find no fault with your logic. And your suggestion is
most congenial. I have no further need for your ship.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: Mister Scott, all systems are now
functioning normally. 
(And in the canyon, the hydra returns underground where it came from)
 [Control room]
 COMPUTER: I invite you and your crew to be my
guests on one condition. 
KIRK: Name it. 
COMPUTER: We must have more of these discussions while you're here. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, would you care to take on that duty? 
SPOCK: I would find it most interesting, Captain. 
KIRK: Then it's agreed. Kirk to Enterprise. 
M'RESS [OC]: Enterprise. Lieutenant M'Ress. 
KIRK: Lieutenant, pass the word by sections. Shore leave is to commence
immediately. 
M'RESS [OC]: Oh, yes sir! 
SPOCK: Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, Spock? 
SPOCK: It appears shore leave has already commenced for certain members
of the crew. 
(On the big screen, Sulu and McCoy are having a picnic with Alice, the
White Rabbit, and the hydra!)

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - Mudd's Passion
Mudd's
Passion
Stardate:
4978.5
Original Airdate: 10 Nov, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 4978.4. We are approaching the Arcadian star
system on a mission to locate an old friend.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Do you think Harry Mudd is down there,
Spock? 
SPOCK: The probability of his presence on Motherlode is eight one
percent plus or minus point five three. 
MCCOY: Why can't you just say, Mudd's probably there. 
SPOCK: I just did, Doctor. 
AREX: Approaching parking orbit, Captain. 
KIRK: Very well, Mister Arex. Spock, let's see how close your
percentage is.
 [Marquee]
 (Harry Mudd is giving his spiel to an audience of
humans and bears) MUDD: Now, you're all heavy metal miners, shrewd and
intelligent. So you can appreciate the incredible value I'm offering.
With this magical liquid, no person of the opposite sex can resist you.
It matters not whether you are young, old, fat, ugly or repugnant. 
(Kirk and Spock beam down) 
MUDD: Nothing personal, gentle beings. 
LADY BEAR: Proof, human. 
MUDD: Proof? Behold. 
(A lovely blonde lady walks up to him) 
LORA: Harry, darling. I was lonely for you. 
MUDD: Behold. I placed a single drop of this miracle substance on
meself, then simply touched this young lady. 
LORA: Please, darling, come back to the ship with me. 
MINER: How much? 
MUDD: Three hundred credits, or the 
MINER: Three hundred? 
MUDD: A bargain, sir. True love is worth any price. Captain Kirk! And
the ineluctable Mister Spock. Welcome to Motherlode, gentlemen.
Interested in purchasing a little love? 
KIRK: We're interested in you, Harry. For fraud, illegal drug
manufacture and swindling. 
MUDD: As I said, welcome to Motherlode, a charming planet which does
not recognise Federation law. 
MINER: So you two can keep out of this. All right, Mudd. You've got a
deal. 
SPOCK: Are you aware that Harry Mudd is tricking you via an illusion? 
MINER: What? 
(Spock fires his phaser at the girl, which turns into a reptile) 
SPOCK: The so-called girl is a Rigelian hypnoid, projecting a simple
illusion. 
(Uproar) 
MUDD: Now, friends. 
KIRK: We can't arrest you, Harry, but you can give yourself up. 
MUDD: No. 
MINER: Thief. 
(The audience start throwing stones) 
MUDD: I surrender myself with free will. Mercy of the law. 
(Spock phasers a ditch and rampart between themselves and the mob)
 [Transporter room]
 MUDD: Ah, that was a miching trick, Kirk. You've
cost me me ship, everything I own. Even the love crystals. I may just
sue you. 
KIRK: Fine. I'll see you in court, Harry.
 [Brig]
 (Chapel tends to where Harry got hit by a rock) 
CHAPEL: A minor bruise, Captain. He'll live. 
KIRK: I thought  we left you on the
robot planet, Harry. Permanently. 
MUDD: Never underestimate the spirit of Harcourt Fenton Mudd. I
borrowed a vehicle. 
SPOCK: Stole a spaceship. 
MUDD: And left to find haven on Ilyra Six. A charming planet, an
innocent and friendly populace. 
KIRK: To whom you sold the Starfleet Space Academy. Harry. 
SPOCK: A fraud. But sold for enough credits to get to Sirius Nine. 
MUDD: Where I discovered a boon to humanoid life, a miracle love
potion. 
KIRK: Which you sold to a thousand inhabitants, who immediately became
ill from using it. 
MUDD: I hadn't counted on their unusual biochemistry. So, I did the
logical thing. I left in haste. 
KIRK: And came here to swindle honest miners. 
MUDD: The love potion works, Captain. If you'll allow me to procure
some from my ship 
(but they leave and activate the forcefield)
 [Corridor]
 (Immediately outside the Brig) 
KIRK: Prepare the arrest report, Mister Spock. 
(Kirk leaves) 
SPOCK I shall require a medical report on the prisoner, Miss Chapel. 
CHAPEL: Of course, Mister Spock. I think you deserve congratulations
for trapping him so cleverly. 
SPOCK: You exaggerate, Nurse. Kindly see that your medical summary is
more precise. 
(Spock leaves) 
MUDD: Your Mister Spock is really a very attractive intelligence. 
CHAPEL: An efficient officer, yes. 
MUDD: But a trifle lacking in the warmer emotions. Now, you, Nurse. You
have a wonderful gift to heal the wounded, a fantastic touch. A
womanly, feminine quality. I appreciate that. And I should like to,
well, thank you. 
(He offers her a crystal) 
CHAPEL: What is it? 
MUDD: My love potion. Not illusion, not trickery, dear Nurse Chapel.
Inside this crystal lies the power to create love. 
CHAPEL: No. No, I've heard of your potions before. I don't believe you.

MUDD: Think about it, darling. Mister Spock in love with you.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: An uncharted star system ahead, Captain. 
SPOCK: Binary sun with a Class M planet. That's rare enough to warrant
investigation. 
KIRK: Agreed. Take us into orbit, Lieutenant Arex.
 [Brig]
 MUDD: It's really so simple, my dear. You rub the
liquid on yourself, then touch another person. 
CHAPEL: And it creates love in that person? Mudd, that is totally
absurd. 
MUDD: No, it is infallible. One touch evokes friendship between men or
women. But between woman and man, love. Guaranteed. You're not simply a
beautiful woman, you are a scientist. I urge you to take this love
crystal as my gift of gratitude to you. Take it, dear Nurse Chapel, and
conduct your own experiment. 
CHAPEL: Not that I believe you, but, well, I suppose I could analyse
it. 
MUDD: Of course.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: Parking orbit stable. Weapons systems on
defensive standby. 
SPOCK: No evidence of intelligent life. Atmosphere at surface, eight
hundred millibars, breathable. Gravity one point two. Temperature hot,
but within Class M limits.
 [Brig]
 (The forcefield is down so Mudd can give Chapel
the crystal) 
CHAPEL: I'll let you know the results of my analysis. 
MUDD: Laboratory tests would destroy it, my dear. Why not test it the
way it's meant to be used? 
CHAPEL: No, I 
MUDD: Ah, darling, think. If it does what I say it does, Spock will be
yours forever, my dear. 
CHAPEL: I just break the capsule and rub it on my skin? 
MUDD: And then touch him. 
(She breaks the capsule between her hands, and gasps) 
CHAPEL: What is it? 
MUDD: A temporary effect as the liquid is absorbed. 
(He steps into the corridor to catch her as she wobbles, and take her
pouch) 
MUDD: It'll pass. 
CHAPEL: I feel better. 
MUDD: Didn't I tell you? 
CHAPEL: You should, you should be in the Brig, Harry. 
MUDD: Oh, right you are, darling. 
(He steps back in and she reactivates the forcefield. 
MUDD: Why don't you go find Spock? Can't waste any time, you know. 
CHAPEL: Yes, I'll do that. (Harry uses what he stole from Christine to
get out of the Brig, and change her photo-ID card so he is now
Lieutenant Christine Chapel)
 [Spock's quarters]
 SPOCK: Yes, Nurse? 
CHAPEL: I brought the medical summary for the arrest report, Mister
Spock. 
(She stumbles and ends up sitting on his lap) 
CHAPEL: Sorry, sir. 
SPOCK: Are you injured, Miss Chapel? 
CHAPEL: No. No, I, I'm fine. Are you feeling all right? 
SPOCK: Perfectly normal. I will append your summary to the report. Was
there something else, Miss Chapel? 
CHAPEL: Wouldn't you like me to, well, stay? Help you? 
SPOCK: That would be illogical, Miss Chapel. 
CHAPEL: Yes. Yes, It'd be stupid.
 [Corridor]
 CHAPEL: Harry Mudd, you swindling 
(She goes to the brig and finds it empty. Then she discovers the pouch
is empty too) 
CHAPEL: Oh, no!
 [Shuttlebay]
 MUDD: Harry Mudd, triumphant again. 
(As he surveys the array of shuttlecraft available to him)
 [Spock's quarters]
 SPOCK: And appended hereto is a medical summary by
Nurse Christine Chapel. Ah, Nurse Chapel's sweet summary. Dear, lovely
Christine.
 [Shuttlebay]
 (Chapel karate-chops Harry to the floor and gets
her possessions back) 
CHAPEL: I've come to collect on your guarantee, Mister Mudd.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Captain. Doctor. I wish to report a, er, a
number of very strange, um, emotions. 
MCCOY: What? 
KIRK: What?
 [Shuttlebay]
 MUDD: You're implying the potion was not
completely successful? 
CHAPEL: Oh, no, it was. I made a complete fool of myself. 
MUDD: But you know how cold Vulcans are. Perhaps it takes a bit more
time for Spock to 
CHAPEL: You're the same fraud you've always been, Harry. I don't know
how I could have believed you. 
MUDD: Well, let's discuss it rationally, my dear. Let's not be hasty. 
CHAPEL: Don't panic, Harry. This phaser is set on stun, not kill.
Activate the intercom. 
MUDD: Now wait a minute. Perhaps that particular crystal was defective.
Here, try another. I assure you 
CHAPEL: Stop it! 
(She fires, missing Harry but hitting the crystals, which then
evaporate into the ventilation system. Then she sets off the Red Alert.
Mudd overpowers her) 
MUDD: Sorry, Christine, but I shall require a temporary hostage.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: Internal security, Captain. 
KIRK: Put it on screen. 
AREX: Shuttlecraft bay. 
(They see Harry carry Chapel into a shuttlecraft) 
SPOCK: Mudd. And he has Christine. She's in danger. My love. 
(Everyone stares, Arex whistles. The shuttlecraft launches) 
SULU: He's going planet side. 
SPOCK: No. Not with my Christine.
 [Shuttlecraft]
 MUDD: Relax, darling. I'll set you down somewhere
safe and then I'll be off discreetly.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: We must go after them, Captain. I'll lead a
landing party. 
MCCOY: Spock, you're obviously not yourself. Maybe some rest. 
SPOCK: Captain, I insist upon going. Christine. I can't stand the
thought of any danger to her, to the woman I love. 
KIRK: Love? 
MCCOY: Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes. I want to protect her, hold her in my arms. 
KIRK: Then I'll transport down with you. 
SPOCK: Good. 
)Spock leaves) 
MCCOY: Jim, is that wise, in his condition? 
KIRK: Try and stop him. It's better if I go with him. 
(Kirk leaves) 
SCOTT: Spock? In love? 
M'RESS: I can't imagine. 
(Then the love vapour comes through the vents) 
SCOTT: Love.
 Captain's log, supplemental. Harry Mudd has
escaped from the Enterprise, taking Head Nurse Chapel with him,
apparently as a hostage. Meanwhile, Mister Spock is acting very
strange.
 [Transporter room]
 SPOCK: Come on. Hurry! If he's harmed one hair on
her pretty head 
MCCOY: Jim, the search party found this in the shuttlecraft bay. 
KIRK: One of Mudd's love crystals. 
MCCOY: Captain, a number of these were broken against the ship's air
system grill. 
KIRK: Lucky for us they don't work. 
MCCOY: Are we sure, Jim? A number of the crew are acting as strange as
Spock. 
SPOCK: Please, Captain. 
KIRK: Check it out, Bones. Send me an immediate report.
 [Bridge]
 M'RESS: Mudd has landed on the planet surface.
Co-ordinates relayed to Transporter room four. 
SCOTT: And the Captain's in transports about it with our ever-loving
Mister Spock. 
M'RESS: You're funny, and very attractive for a human.
 [Planet surface]
 MUDD: They'll find you soon enough, me little
poppet. You'll be safe and I'll be long gone. 
CHAPEL: Gone where? The planet's a desert. 
MUDD: There's always a market for an ingenious man. Once, I recall, on
Omega Cygni, I turned a handsome profit selling the natives their own
oceans. 
CHAPEL: We haven't seen any traces of intelligent life. Of any life. 
MUDD: Then you can relax. There's no danger, ay? We'll get you set up
top class. Don't bother to thank me. 
CHAPEL: Well, I hadn't planned on it. 
(Does that rocky outcrop look like it has forelegs with claws? Yes, and
it opens a yellow eye to prove it)
 [Bridge]
 (The bridge crew are so relaxed, Arex is playing a
lute with all three hands) 
AREX: By the way, anybody keeping a trace on the Captain and Mister
Spock? 
M'RESS: Sure, Arex.
 [Planet surface]
 (Kirk and Spock materialise. Kirk grabs Spock as
his foot sinks into the soft sand) 
SPOCK: Thanks Jim. It's good to have a friend like you. 
KIRK: Strange, that's the way I feel about you, too. My dear friend,
Spock. Come, let's go get Mudd and Christine. 
(The rock creature raises itself up, causing a small ground quake. It
smashes the shuttlecraft. Three phasers make it annoyed. Then another
one wakes up) 
SPOCK: Darling, are you all right? 
CHAPEL: D-darling? 
MUDD: Kirk, get us out of here. 
KIRK: Transporter room, emergency beam up now. 
(But the transporter technician is dancing with someone and taking no
notice) 
KIRK: They're not responding. 
SPOCK: Don't worry. You'll be safe, darling. 
CHAPEL: Yes, Spock. How wonderful. 
MUDD: They're coming closer. 
KIRK: Emergency beam up. Enterprise, come in. No response. Spock, can't
you take your hands off her? 
SPOCK: That's my affair. 
CHAPEL: Captain, please. 
KIRK: I think we should get a few things straight. 
SPOCK: Jim. No. Captain. We're both reacting to the drug. The love
potion. 
MUDD: It worked? 
KIRK: Yes, we have to control our emotional reactions. 
MUDD: It worked! And I was selling those crystals to lump-headed miners
for a miserable three hundred credits.
 [Rec room]
 MCCOY: Did I ever tell you about the time I saved
Captain Kirk's life? Or Spock's? 
(The woman shakes her head) 
MCCOY: And my dear friend Scotty. And that pretty little Lieutenant
Uhura. I've saved just about everybody on this here ship. If the
Enterprise had a heart, I'd save her too. Now, let's talk about your
heart, my dear.
 [Planet surface]
 KIRK: How long does the effect of the potion last,
Harry? 
MUDD: I, I don't know. Not long, according to the creature I swindled,
I purchased the crystals from. 
CHAPEL: Look! 
(The creatures are coming) 
KIRK: Keep trying to contact the Enterprise. Maybe we can distract
them. 
SPOCK: That is an outstandingly stupid idea. I'm sorry. The drug. I
simply doubt that we can appeal to their better nature. If they have
one. 
KIRK: Harry, do you have any of the crystals left? 
MUDD: Two. No! They're worth a fortune. No. My friends, dear Christine,
for you, for all of us.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: I've got a hangover to shame all previous
hangovers. And I did not touch a drop of Scotch. 
M'RESS: Not so loud, you fool. 
SCOTT: Yeah, well, all of a sudden I don't like you much either. 
CHAPEL [OC]: Come in, Enterprise. Emergency beam up. Repeat, emergency.

M'RESS: Enterprise here.
 [Planet surface]
 CHAPEL: I made contact. 
KIRK: Great. I hope we last long enough to be beamed up. Phasers ready.
I'll need help. 
(They fire, then as one opens it's mouth to roar again, Kirk throws the
crystals in. The thing becomes nice to the tiny humans, and nasty
towards it's fellow rock creature. The four are beamed away before a
tail comes slamming down where they were standing)
 [Brig]
 (Chapel is recording Mudd's full confession) 
MUDD: And then on Ophiucus Six, I conned two miners out of a year's
supply of dilithium crystals with fake Federation vouchers. 
(Spock enters) 
SPOCK: May I help you record his confession, Nurse? 
CHAPEL: You? You'd be the last person I'd choose. 
SPOCK: A few moments of love, paid for with several hours of hatred.
Your potion is scarcely a bargain, Harry. 
MUDD: Ah, well, Spock. So few things in this universe are perfect.
Think I'll get rehabilitation therapy again? 
SPOCK: I can guarantee it. 
MUDD: Well, that's all right. I just hate to leave you all. All my
loved ones.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - The Terratin
Incident
The
Terratin Incident
Stardate:
5577.3
Original Airdate: 17 Nov, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5577.3. We are approaching the remains of the
burnt out supernova Arachna. Requested update survey will begin with
measurements of its radiation and volume expansion.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Arachna is entering its cycle of strongest
emissions, Captain. 
KIRK: Uhura, inform Starbase Twenty Three we have arrived at the gas
cloud and are starting to map. 
UHURA: Captain, I'm getting some interference on subspace extreme upper
registers. If it's a signal, I don't recognise it. 
KIRK: Source? 
UHURA: The star Cepheus. From its single satellite. That area's never
produced radio transmissions before. 
KIRK: Put it on the speaker. 
SPOCK: Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception
capability. 
KIRK: Could be a natural radio source newly energised by 
SPOCK: Correction. One isolated word pattern detected. If you accept
intersat code as still operative. 
UHURA: Intersat? That's been out of use for two centuries. 
SPOCK: The code word is t-e-r-r-a-t-i-n. 
UHURA: It's stopped now, sir. No response at all to our signal. 
SPOCK: Computers show no immediate information on the word terratin. 
KIRK: Was the word totally random, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, lay in a course for Cepheus. 
SULU: Aye, sir. 
MCCOY: Jim, you don't mean you're going to abandon the mapping mission
to check out some meaningless signal? 
KIRK: Meaningless at the moment, Bones, but it was sent twice. Odds
against that occurring in a totally random transmission are too high to
ignore. There may be some intelligence trying to contact us. Mister
Spock, continue research on the word terratin. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
MCCOY: It's a waste of time if you ask me. 
(Arriving at the star) 
SPOCK: Only data is from early exploration. Planet is listed as Class
M, core molten, mantle and crust entirely crystalline. 
KIRK: But nothing in the computer banks about surface eruptions.
There's our likely radio source, simply crystalline projections of
recent volcanic activity. 
(But down on the planet, a radio dish is definitely doing something) 
KIRK: Set for a single elliptic orbit. 
SULU: Aye, sir. Entering orbit now. 
SPOCK: I register a disturbance, Captain. As if an impulse just passed
through the ship. 
KIRK: Type and source? 
SPOCK: Unidentified. It's extremely faint and diffused. Captain, I
suggest we delay orbit until it can be analysed for nature and effect. 
KIRK: Bridge reports. 
SULU: All instruments functioning, ship's condition normal, all area
status lights are green. 
AREX: Sensors detect nothing abnormal, sir. 
KIRK: Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, how are your engines?
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Purring like happy kittens, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Bridge to Sickbay. Bones, we've just
recorded an unidentified impulse. Any effect on sensitive lab animals?
 [Medical lab]
 MCCOY: Nothing, Jim. The gossamer mice show no
signs of shock. 
(The mice are semi-transparent) 
CHAPEL: Our halo fish is bright as ever, Doctor. Now, this species
loses all colour at the least environmental change. 
KIRK [OC]: Very well.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Well, Spock, your x-waves seem harmless
enough. Make your analysis while we proceed into orbit. Commence your
sensor sweep, Mister Arex. 
AREX: Sensors show crystalline surface heavily fractured by lava flows.
Ash and smoke suspended in oxygen-nitrogen atmos 
(He's cut off by a loud noise, and the Enterprise glows like a halo
fish) 
AREX: My eyes! 
(Everybody glows for a while, then it stops as suddenly as it started) 
KIRK: Anyone hurt here? 
VARIOUS: No, sir. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Arex? 
AREX: No injury, sir. 
UHURA: Damage reports, all ship areas, damage reports. 
SULU: All instruments functioning normally. Maintaining orbit. But
strictly on impulse power, sir. 
SPOCK: Wave bombardment reduced, but continuing. Deflector shields
ineffective.
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: No casualties reported, Jim.
 [Bridge]
 MCCOY [OC]: What happened? 
KIRK: Don't know yet.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Engineering. No casualties, Captain, but
trouble aplenty with the engines. Every dilithium crystal connection's
smashed in the warp engine circuitry. We're trying to bypass them now.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: What about main circuits? 
SCOTT: Well, you have to see it to believe it, sir. Those big crystals
in there have come apart. Each of them unpeeling like the rind of an
orange.
 [Engineering]
 KIRK: Analysis, Spock. 
SCOTT: Our only hope now is rewiring impulse. But there are a thousand
broken connections. 
SPOCK: Captain, this is quite unprecedented. Notice the fracturing is
spiro-form, similar to long chain molecules. 
KIRK: But dilithium molecules are the hardest, most rigid 
GABLER: Mister Scott! More trouble with the circuit work. 
SCOTT: What now, Gabler? 
GABLER: All the tools, sir. They're too big for us to handle. 
SCOTT: You sound like you're blathering, man. Wait, I'm coming. 
KIRK: Spock, are you slumping? 
SPOCK: I have never slumped in my life, Captain, but I was about to ask
you the same 
BRIEL [OC]: Security! Anyone, please! Mess Officer Briel requesting
help in the Main Dining Room. Tables, chairs, silverware, everything
seems to have enlarged. Women losing rings, hairpins. Some are near
panic.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Captain, the most incredible thing is
happening. 
KIRK: We know. The whole ship has apparently expanded. 
SPOCK: An equally good possibility is that ship's personnel have
contracted, and may be continuing to shrink. 
KIRK: Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Shut down all unnecessary
systems. Get every ounce of impulse power. We've got to get away from
this planet.
 Captain's log, stardate 5577.5. Our limited power
attempt to escape the planet's gravity has failed. Undefined wave
bombardment continues, resulting in a contraction of our bodies, or an
expansion of the ship, by a factor of point three.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: No reply to our mayday, Captain. I don't
believe we have enough power to transmit to Starbase Twenty Three. 
KIRK: Very well. Spock, what have you learned about the wave bombarding
us? 
SPOCK: Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience. 
SCOTT [OC]: Engineering to Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here. How are they holding out, Scotty? 
SCOTT [OC]: We've replaced all the damaged parts we can. With all
that's draining them, the well will soon enough run dry, sir. 
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Kirk out. Uhura, reduce mayday signals. One
per ten minute cycle. Cut down sensor sweeps, Mister Arex. 
AREX: Visual sweeps are already impossible, sir. My eyes no longer fit
the opticals. 
UHURA: (climbing on the console) And I can't reach the dial I turned
five minutes ago. 
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay. 
MCCOY [OC]: Sickbay. McCoy here. 
KIRK: Bones, I need some answers. What's happening to us? 
MCCOY [OC]: Come down tot the lab, Jim. I may have something for you
now.
 [Medical lab]
 MCCOY: There's the test tissue, Jim, compared with
the stable infrared. 
KIRK: Then Spock's theory is right. We're contracting. 
MCCOY: That's why our weight remains the same, same number of atoms.
The effect is just reducing the space between the molecules. It's
something I've never seen before. 
SPOCK: Agreed. And it is accelerating. 
KIRK: How long can it keep on? 
SPOCK: Ad infinitum, perhaps, considering distance between atoms is
relatively as great as between stars. 
CHAPEL: Doctor McCoy, the animals! They're getting too small for the
cage mesh. All the gossamers are out. And look how tiny they've gotten.
They're just like halo fish. It's tadpole-sized now. 
(Spock notices Christine's bracelet) 
SPOCK: Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration? 
CHAPEL: It was made for me by the titanium smiths of Libra, but it was
an arm bracelet. More like a necklace now. 
SPOCK: Yet the uniform on which you wear it fits as well as ever.
Uniform made of algae-based xenylon, I believe. 
MCCOY: Aren't all our uniforms xenylon? 
KIRK: Yes, and they've all been shrinking proportionately with us. 
SPOCK: This coral decoration for the aquarium is also shrinking. yet
the meteoritic rock in there is unchanged. 
MCCOY: That means only organic matter is affected. But how? 
SPOCK: The wave tends to wind tight such spiral molecules as dilithium.
There is one other molecular structure 
KIRK: Of course, the double helix of DNA, nucleus of every cell in our
bodies. What happens when DNA is compacted completely? 
MCCOY: The strands wouldn't break, Jim, they'd just quit winding. 
KIRK: Then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: It's possible. I'll feed the data into the
computer banks. 
KIRK: Something else we'd better determine first. How long can we
expect to maintain control of our ship? 
SPOCK: The computer will project the point at which systems' switches
and buttons will be beyond our ability to operate.
 Captain's log, stardate 5577.7. We will lose
effective control of this vessel at the point when we've become
approximately one centimetre tall. At the present rate, we will reach
this less-than-fingernail length in thirty two minutes.
 [Bridge]
 (Sulu and Ares are standing on ladders to reach
their consoles) 
KIRK: Spock, how small will we ultimately shrink? 
SPOCK: No information on that as yet, sir. I do have one read-out on
full spiroid wave analysis. That will take approximately eight years. 
KIRK: Bypass that analysis. We've got twenty nine minutes before we're
too small to operate ship controls. Everyone continue to jury-rig
miniature control mechanisms. There's nothing more we can do. 
SULU: But there is, Captain. Request permission to direct phaser fire
at the planet. Just let me set for ten seconds, sir. 
KIRK: Aiming at what, Mister Sulu? So far all source studies have shown
the waves come from an area as large as one sixth the planet's surface.
Phaser fire will only waste power. 
SULU: What good will it do to wait like this? Just one burst sir, one
single 
(The navigation dial moves and knocks Sulu to the floor - a long way
down) 
KIRK: Sulu! I think his leg's broken. We'll need a splint. 
(Sulu is splinted up) 
KIRK: Let's get him to Sickbay. Every one back to stations. 
(But there's a problem, as everyone is now so small even Spock has to
lean hard on a button to activate it) 
KIRK: The electric eye. We've grown too small to make it work. 
(He finds a pin or something similar on the floor and waves it in front
of the detector. The turbolift doors open)
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: What happened? 
KIRK: He fell from the console top. 
MCCOY: More and more fall injuries coming. Compound fracture. 
CHAPEL: Oh, if only we could use our bone-knitting laser. Doctor McCoy.
That microscope laser, the one designed to heal the middle ear,
wouldn't it work here? 
MCCOY: It's certainly worth a try. 
CHAPEL: It's in the lab shelf supplies. I'll get it.
 [Medical lab]
 (She gets the tiny instrument, but then trips over
something and falls into the fish tank) 
CHAPEL: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! 
(Kirk does the assault course of chairs and table-tops to try and get
to her) 
CHAPEL: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! 
(As she starts to sink, he throws a needle like a javelin. It has a
line of thread attached to it. She grabs it and is pulled out) 
KIRK: No more climbing heights for you, Nurse. Got that clear? 
CHAPEL: Yes, Captain. But I've also got the miniature laser.
 [Sickbay]
 KIRK: How is it, Sulu? 
SULU: I can feel it knitting, sir. 
SPOCK: Results on DNA reduction limits have come through, Captain. 
KIRK: What are they? 
SPOCK: Factor of thirty two point nine. 
KIRK: In other words, we're going down to one sixteenth of an inch
high. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Well past the operative point of Enterprise
controls. 
KIRK: Can you calculate the geographic centre of the wave emissions
from the planet's surface? 
SPOCK: Easily, Captain. May I ask the purpose? 
KIRK: It's as good a place as any to beam down. 
(He opens a communicator almost as big as he is) 
KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, can you hear me? 
SCOTT [OC]: Barely, sir. 
KIRK: Get a crew down to transporter room three. We have twenty minutes
left while we can still operate transporter controls. 
SCOTT [OC]: How many beaming down, Captain? 
KIRK: One, Scotty. Myself.
 Captain's log, supplemental. There is one last
measure we can take to try and stop the bombardment of the lethal
spiroid wave. There must be some intelligence behind it. I'm going to
attempt direct communication by beaming down to the planet's surface.
We have no reason to expect success, but our height is little more than
two inches and even this action will be beyond us in fifteen minutes
time.
 [Transporter room]
 (As Scott and his engineers arrange a system of
'ropes' around the slider controls) 
SPOCK: This is the best I could do in rigging so small a communicator,
sir. 
KIRK: Thanks, Spock. 
SPOCK: It's range cannot be guaranteed. How will we pinpoint you for
return in case it fails? 
KIRK: Scotty, set automatic return for me. If there's anything to be
found down there, ten minutes should do it. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir. Timer being set. 
SPOCK: Captain, the transporter retains a memory of the body's
molecular structure. Will it apply as well to your present height? 
KIRK: We'll know that in ten minutes. After that, it won't matter
anymore. Prepare to energise. 
SPOCK: Good luck, sir. 
KIRK: Energise! 
SCOTT: All right then. Heave, lads. Heave!
 [Planet surface]
 (Kirk opens his hand to reveal the tiny
communicator in his palm) 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. I think we have an answer to the height
problem. The transporter beam apparently returns our molecules to
normal spacing. Kirk to Enterprise, do you read me? 
SPOCK [OC]: We read you, Captain. Wave bombardment has just ceased. 
KIRK: I think I see 
(But a volcanic eruption knocks him off his feet and he drops the
communicator. It gets hit with a globule of lava. Kirk runs for it,
dodging lava flows until he finds a miniature city. Then he is caught
in a transporter beam)
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: Scotty? Spock?
 [Bridge]
 (Everyone is so small he can hardly see them) 
KIRK: Scotty, is it you? 
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. For the love of heaven, be careful where you step.

KIRK: Is everyone safe? 
SCOTT: Captain, you'll deafen us for sure! 
(Kirk drops his voice to a whisper) 
KIRK: Everyone accounted for? 
SCOTT: All but the Bridge crew, sir! They were trying to man their
posts here when all of a sudden they were beamed away. Every living one
of them! 
KIRK: All personnel, away from helm area. Go to the far bulkhead. 
(He works the helm controls then goes to Uhura's station) 
KIRK: Message to the inhabitants of the city on the planet below. I
hope you can receive this frequency and understand my words. Your
survival depends on it. All this ship's armament is locked on the
co-ordinates of your city. A demonstration, in case you doubt. 
(A crystal outcrop by the city is disintegrated) 
KIRK: You have one minute to restore my Bridge crew unharmed, or you
will undergo full barrage. 
(The viewscreen comes to life and shows a group of red-headed people,
dressed in yellow and green) 
MENDANT [on viewscreen]: In the name of the Terratin people, I forbid
you to destroy us, Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: You forbid me after what you've done to my people? 
MENDANT [on viewscreen]: I am Mendant of all this city, equal in
command to yourself. We are people of pride, Captain, equal to your
own. We neither suffer insult nor give apology for actions. But I give
them now, for damage done your starship. Be assured, this land contains
much dilithium to replace that you lost. 
KIRK: Where are my officers? 
MENDANT [on viewscreen]: I request you to understand. We tried to tell
you our plight as you passed, that our adopted planet is dying. But our
great antenna was buried. We had no choice but to use our invasion
defence to reach you. 
KIRK: You still haven't answered my question. Either you tell me what's
happened to my people 
AREX [on viewscreen: Here we are, Captain. 
SULU [on viewscreen]: We're down here in the Capitol building of the
Terratins, sir. They beamed us down with their transporters. See for
yourself. 
(The image pans around. Spock is working at a computer, of course) 
KIRK: Spock, who are the Terratins? Where'd they come from?
 [Capitol]
 SPOCK: Descendants of an early lost colony, which
is why they retain some knowledge of starship methods such as
transporter mechanisms. These Earth colonists named and numbered this
planet Terra Ten.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK [OC]: Hence the present corruption of their
name. 
KIRK: There've been no Earth colonists a sixteenth of an inch tall.
 [Capitol]
 SPOCK: Exactly why they were lost, Captain. Spirod
epsilon waves are natural here, and shrank them to this size. It has
become a genetic characteristic now.
 [Bridge]
 MENDANT [on viewscreen]: Our ancestors were too
small ever to be found again, Captain Kirk. We had to build our own
world, master our own ways, our own defence. We sought no outsiders,
asked no help. Now you see, Captain Kirk. We are about to lose all. We
had to force help from your ship. 
KIRK: Your actions all but lost us our ship. 
MENDANT [on viewscreen]: I do not know how to beg. I can only request.
Save as many of my people as you can.
 [Capitol]
 UHURA: They had no other way to reach us except to
make us their size. They didn't mean us harm, sir.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: I can help no one under present conditions.
All Bridge crew prepare to beam aboard. Each of you carry as much
dilithium as you can find. 
MENDANT [on viewscreen]: The Captain orders dilithium. Bring the
largest crystals in the city.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: Bridge crew, prepare to beam up.
 [Capitol]
 (With crystals around their feet, which makes them
microscopic) 
SPOCK: Energise, Captain.
 [Transporter room]
 (The crystals have retained a relative size to the
crew) 
UHURA: Nice to be back aboard, sir, and fitting the room again. 
KIRK: All crew personnel report to Transporter rooms immediately.
Prepare to beam down to planet surface. 
SPOCK: The Terratins are making available all possible dilithium. The
crystals are small, but I believe they will provide enough power until
we can obtain larger pieces. 
KIRK: Sulu, take over the transporter here. Spock.
 [Capitol]
 (Earthquakes are splitting the ground near the
city) 
MENDANT: Inform your captain. Great earth cracks will soon swallow all.
He must tell us. Shall we prepare to be rescued or to die?
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: How's the helm, Sulu? 
SULU: Responsive, sir. 
UHURA: Subspace radio now operational, sir. Starbase Twenty Three is
reading. 
SCOTT: Last of the crew beamed up, sir. Dilithium supplies are fully
restored. 
KIRK: Mister Arex, prepare for immediate departure from this area. 
SPOCK: Captain, what about the people on the planet? 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, direct forward phasers at the Terratin city. Set for
pinpoint fire pattern.
 [Transporter room]
 (The phaser is fired, and the city is beamed
aboard) 
KIRK: Spock, the macroscope. (viewing the tiny people) Mendant, we
welcome your people aboard the Enterprise. 
MENDANT [through macroscope]: Captain Kirk, we welcome your eye upon
our city. 
KIRK: We're now headed for your new home. The planet Verdanis, ten days
distant. 
MENDANT [through macroscope]: Is it beautiful, as we were told? 
KIRK: Very beautiful, much like Earth. 
MENDANT [through macroscope]: People of the Enterprise, we have no way
to pay the debt we owe. But this at least comes from a meeting of all
our numbers. We name you honorary Terratins now, and for all time to
come. 
SPOCK: We came rather close to making it more than honorary. 
KIRK: Yes, I'd say just about a sixteenth of an inch close.
 Captain's log, supplemental. The Lilliputian city
is to be taken to Verdanis and relocated on a fertile and well-watered
plain. Then we'll be able to call the Terratin incident closed.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - The Time Trap
The
Time Trap
Stardate:
5267.6
Original Airdate: 24 Nov, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 52.2. We have just entered the Delta Triangle,
a vast, uninhabited sector of our galaxy in which a high number of
mysterious disappearances of starships have been recorded since ancient
times. The Enterprise has been assigned the mission of surveying this
area, and if possible, determining the cause of these disappearances.
 [Bridge]
 (There is a continual fireworks display on the
viewscreen. The ship is at Red Alert) 
KIRK: Situation, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Our sensors are in a state of chaos, Captain. They became
unreliable when we entered the Triangle. 
KIRK: Magnification ten on forward scanners, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Magnification ten, sir. 
KIRK: Klingon battle cruiser. Deflector shields up, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Deflectors up, sir. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. 
(The Klingon ship fires two shots, which harmlessly hit the shields) 
KIRK: Ready phasers. 
SULU: Phasers locked on target, sir. 
KIRK: Fire. 
SULU: Firing phasers.
(A hit. The Klingon ship vanishes) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, did you see what I think I just saw? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
KIRK: Explanation? 
SPOCK: I can offer none at this time. However, the Klingon ship was not
destroyed by our phaser fire. Its shields clearly deflected the
phasers. Nor was its disappearance the type that would have been
affected if it were using its cloaking device. 
KIRK: Any sensor analysis on that wavering effect just before the ship
disappeared? 
SPOCK: The sensors are still not registering normally, sir. But I would
venture the theory it has something to do with the many ship
disappearances in this area. 
KIRK: A natural phenomenon. But what? Duty personnel on Yellow Alert.
Visual scan three hundred and sixty degrees, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Scanning three hundred and sixty degrees, sir. 
(There are other ships surrounding them) 
KIRK: Mousetrapped. If the first ship doesn't succeed in blasting us
out of existence, they have two backup ships to do the job. 
SPOCK: Tactically well planned. When the Federation investigates, we'll
be recorded as just another mysterious starship disappearance. 
UHURA: Captain, we are receiving a class two signal from the lead
Klingon vessel. 
KIRK: One moment, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu, on my command, I want you to
turn the Enterprise and head for the exact co-ordinates where the
Klingon ship disappeared. Warp eight. 
SULU: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Put the signal on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and pipe
the entire exchange back to Starfleet Command. 
UHURA: It will take three weeks to reach the nearest starbase, sir. 
KIRK: Nonetheless, let's have it on the record. 
UHURA: Aye, sir. Signal in. 
KURI [on viewscreen]: You have been identified as the starship
Enterprise. Captain James T Kirk last known to be in command. 
KIRK: Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. 
KURI [on viewscreen]: I am Commander Kuri of the Klingon Imperial
Fleet. We have witnessed the destruction of our sister ship, the
Klothos, and hold you responsible. Surrender immediately or we will
destroy you. 
KIRK: We did not destroy the Klothos, and you are well aware of it,
Commander. 
KURI [on viewscreen]: Surely you don't expect me to believe she just
vanished? 
KIRK: You may believe what you like, Commander. We were fired upon
first and returned fire. The Klothos deflectors turned aside our phaser
fire and then disappeared. I don't know why. But we are in the Delta
Triangle. 
KURI [on viewscreen]: I do not accept this. 
KIRK: Frankly, Commander, what you accept is of little importance to
me. Enterprise out. Now, Mister Sulu.
 [Klingon ship]
 KURI: What fools! Thinking they can escape.
Accelerate to maximum and prepare to open fire.
 [Bridge]
 (Weapons fire hits the Enterprise) 
SCOTT: Sir, aren't we going to defend ourselves? 
KIRK: Your deflector shields are doing that for us, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: But to just turn and run, sir. 
KIRK: We'll fight if we have to. Sulu, are we headed for the exact
co-ordinates where the Klothos disappeared? 
SULU: Dead on, sir. We'll be there in ten seconds. 
SCOTT: Captain, our deflector shields have just gone out. 
SULU: Sir, the instruments. They've gone haywire. I can't orient
myself. Everything is 
UHURA: Subspace radio channels are dead, sir. 
(Red Alert sounds, and the Enterprise disappears)
 [Klingon ship]
 KURI: Where did they go?
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Captain, I've lost all co-ordination.
Dizzy. 
SPOCK: Sir, we seem to be suffering from some form of vertigo. 
KIRK: Sulu, are we still on the same co-ordinates? 
SULU: I can't tell, sir. Vision won't focus. 
(He collapses, then the Enterprise reappears) 
SPOCK: Captain, on the viewscreen. 
(A starship graveyard as far as they can see) 
KIRK: It's like a vast Sargasso Sea. A graveyard of ships from every
civilisation imaginable. 
UHURA: Where are we, sir? 
KIRK: At another place in time, I think. If we check closely, I believe
we'll find many of those ships are the ones designated as lost in the
Delta Triangle. 
UHURA: An alternate universe? 
KIRK: Something corresponding to that. The records say every ship lost
here vanished without a trace. Most logged communication loss and
disorientation just before disappearance. My guess was they entered a
window to some other continuum. Comments, Spock? 
SPOCK: Your logic is excellent, Captain. There is a random factor to
the ship disappearances. Perhaps the touching of the two time
continuums is erratic. In any event, the window stayed open long enough
for us to follow the Klothos in. 
SCOTT: Aye, and where is that tricky devil? 
SULU: I've been scanning for her, but there are so many ships here it's
hard to pick up a specific trace. 
KIRK: Stay on it, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Aye, sir. 
SCOTT: There are ships here I've only seen crude drawings of, pictures
in museums. 
SPOCK: Sensor scans give a rough approximation of the age of the metal
in the hulls, Captain. Some of them have been here for centuries. 
SCOTT: Captain, there's the old Bonaventure. She was the first ship to
have warp drive installed. She vanished without a trace on her third
voyage. 
(Bonaventure looks very like a fat Enterprise, with 0201NCC on the
nacelle)
SPOCK: The crew's descendants may still be living, Captain. 
KIRK: Their descendants? 
SPOCK: Yes. I am picking up life and energy readings from the cluster
of ships ahead of us.
 [Klothos Bridge]
 KAZ: Scanners indicate the Enterprise shields are
totally depleted, sir. 
KOR: Good. All hands to battle stations. Prepare to open fire on the
Enterprise immediately.
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Captain, the Klothos, dead ahead. 
KIRK: Sound Red Alert. Phasers lock on target. 
SULU: Aye, sir. Phasers locked on.
 [Klothos Bridge]
 KOR: Fire! 
KAZ: Sir, our weaponry is frozen.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Fire. 
SULU: Firing phasers. 
KIRK: Report, sir. 
SULU: No response, sir. There's no indication of damage. All
instruments register normal. 
(Then Kirk disappears)
 Captain's log, supplemental. First Officer Spock
recording. We appear to be in an alternate universe. Position,
undetermined. Captain Kirk has been transported from the ship by an
unknown power. His present location also is undetermined.
 [Council chamber]
 (Kor appears in front of a giant horseshoe-shaped
table. There are people of all different races sitting behind it,
including a Gorn, Tellarite, Klingon, Andorian, Orion, Phylosian. He
reaches for his weapon but is unable to take hold of it) 
 
XERIUS: (a Vulcan or Romulan) That will not be needed here, Commander
Kor. 
(Then Kirk is beamed in) 
XERIUS: Welcome to Elysia. Devna, Interpreter of Laws. 
DEVNA (an Orion woman) Gentlemen, you now stand before the Ruling
Council. Elysia is comprised of representatives of a hundred and twenty
three races. Our existence dates back over one thousand years. During
this time, these diverse races, many of whom were enemies on the
outside, have learned to live together because they must. As a result,
any act of violence is strictly forbidden, and will be dealt with
swiftly and with utmost severity. Questions? 
KIRK: Are we in an alternate universe? 
DEVNA: It is more aptly described as a pocket in the garment of time. 
KOR: How did you freeze my weaponry? 
DEVNA: We have among us many individuals gifted with psionic powers,
peace being our single goal. You were attempting to break that peace. 
XERIUS: Pronounce the law. 
DEVNA: Under our law, you as ship captains are responsible for the
behaviour of your crews. Should a crew member, with or without your
knowledge, engage in any form of violence whatsoever, you will suffer
the ultimate penalty. Total immobilisation of your ship for a century. 
KOR: A century? We'd all be dead by the end of it. 
XERIUS: No, Commander Kor. This small universe of ours is a curios
trap. Time passes here, but very slowly. A century means nothing to us.
Our Council appears young. Yet all are centuries old. 
KIRK: Your life here must be almost perfect, if you haven't wanted to
leave. 
XERIUS: All of us have wanted to leave at some time, Captain Kirk. But
we have made the best possible world here, because we have found there
is no escape from it.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: We are getting out. 
SCOTT: Then we'd better do it pretty quick, Captain. 
SPOCK: If we find an answer, it will still take time. 
SCOTT: That's just what we haven't got. 
KIRK: What's wrong, Scotty? 
SCOTT: It's our dilithium crystals, sir. They're deteriorating rapidly.

KIRK: But how? 
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. Maybe because of the time warp we went
through. But we've only four days at the most before power goes. 
KIRK: Got any miracles in your computer, Spock? 
SPOCK: Impossible to predict, Captain. 
KIRK: I don't want a prediction. You will start work immediately,
around the clock, nonstop, until you arrive at a formula that gets us
out of here.
 [Klothos Bridge]
 KOR: These computations are useless. Get out of
here and don't come back until you have a plan that works. 
KAZ: Yes, sir.
 [Council chamber]
 DEVNA: What do you see beyond your eyes, Magen? 
MAGEN: (red-head with yellow cat's eyes) Two new ships. In each, beings
labour to solve the riddle. The riddle of the time trap escape. Escape.

DEVNA: Gently, good Magen. Return to us now. 
XERIUS: It is impossible. 
DEVNA: They must try, Xerius. They all must try before they accept.
 [Briefing room]
 KIRK: This is the best you could come up with,
Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Have you covered every possibility? Every factor? 
SPOCK: Several times, Captain. I do not wish to surrender hope, but the
facts remain unchangeable. 
KIRK: He isn't giving up. If they can do it, why can't we? 
SPOCK: I do not believe they can, sir. High rank probability. Their S2
graf unit, which is roughly the equivalent of our warp drive, began
giving off depleted energy readings. Kor decided to try to bluff it
through. 
KIRK: Jeopardising his crew and his ship unnecessarily?
 [Klothos Bridge]
 KAZ: All power has been diverted to the engines,
sir. We're picking up speed. 
(The Klothos heads into a vortex, vanishes, and gets thrown back into
the graveyard where she started)
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: You were right, Spock. But I almost wish
they'd made it. 
SPOCK: Their attempt has given me an idea as to how we may be able to
break through the time barrier.
 [Briefing room]
 KIRK: Mister Spock has come up with a formula
which may just get us out of here. 
SCOTT: But this involves combining our ship with the Klothos. 
KIRK: That is correct. 
MCCOY: You mean you want us to co-operate with those 
KIRK: If we want to get out of here, it's our only choice. 
SULU: It's a complicated navigation problem, trying to guide two such
disparate ships. 
SCOTT: Considering we only have two days left before our supply of
dilithium crystals is exhausted, I say we go with this plan. 
SULU: I agree, sir. 
KIRK: Good. I'll contact Kor right away.
 [Council chamber]
 XERIUS: What is it? 
DEVNA: These new ones. Now they plan to combine the two ships and try
again. Can you not stop them, Xerius? 
XERIUS: It is not against our laws to try to escape. 
DEVNA: But they may kill themselves in these mad attempts. 
XERIUS: So long as they do not break our laws, we must not impede them.

DEVNA: Even if they die? 
XERIUS: It is their choice.
 [Klothos briefing room]
 KIRK: Then it's settled. Our science teams will
get to work right away conjoining our warp and navigation systems so we
will function as a single ship. Exchange of personnel and computer
hookup to start as soon as we are beamed back to our ship. 
KOR: Agreed. 
KIRK: Mister Spock? 
(Spock gets up and puts his hands on the two Klingon's shoulders) 
SPOCK: I cannot tell you how impressed I am by your splendid spirit of
co-operation. 
KOR: Mister Spock! 
SPOCK: Forgive me, Commander. I was overcome by the moment. Goodbye. 
KOR: Goodbye, Mister Spock. Captain Kirk. 
(Kirk and Spock leave) 
KAZ: The stories of his being half human must be true. 
KOR: Perhaps the time continuum affected his mind. 
KAZ: I wonder if we all haven't become affected. 
KOR: Explain yourself. 
KAZ: Your willingness to work with your old enemy, Kirk. It is not like
you, Commander. What do you really have in mind? 
KOR: You do know me, Kaz. Very well, what would you think if the
Enterprise suddenly disintegrated after our dual ship had pierced the
time continuum? 
KAZ: I would think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly. 
KOR: And it can be arranged, practically speaking? 
KAZ: It implies a rather high risk factor, given the time involved and
Kirk's highly suspicious nature. But I believe it can be arranged. 
KOR: Very good, Kaz. I will leave it to you to attend to the details of
the Enterprise's destruction.
 Captain's log, stardate 5267.6. We are in the
final stages preparatory to making our escape from Elysia.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: We must make our escape by tomorrow or our
dilithium crystals will be too depleted, and we will be trapped here
forever. 
GABLER: Beg your pardon, sir. 
KIRK: What is it, Gabler. 
GABLER: Bell and I are the relief guard for the dilithium vault. We
arrived a few minutes late and found them poking around. 
KLINGON: We were lost. 
GABLER: Lost, my foot. It's clearly posted as a restricted area. You
knew you weren't supposed to be there. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I'm sure there has been a mistake. (hands on
shoulders) Where are you supposed to be working? 
KLINGON: Engineering, deck five. 
SPOCK: Captain, allow me to escort this young man to his work area. 
KIRK: Very well, Mister Spock. 
(Spock and the Klingons leave) 
KIRK: Return to your post and don't leave it until you've been
relieved. 
GABLER: Aye, sir. 
MCCOY: Jim, I'm worried about Spock. He's just not acting normal. 
KIRK: He's under a lot of pressure, Bones. 
MCCOY: I know that. But I've never known Spock to act like a pal under
any circumstances, least of all toward Klingons. 
KIRK: That's true. 
MCCOY: And if he's coming apart, Jim, we're in serious trouble. Getting
out of here hinges on his computations. 
KIRK: I'll talk to him, Bones. It's all I can do.
 [Briefing room]
 KIRK: Everything seems to be in order. But then
you're the only person who can really be sure. Isn't that right, Spock?

SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Why do you ask? 
KIRK: Your recent behaviour. Is something wrong? 
SPOCK: I believe there is, Captain. But not within me. I sensed
something strange about the Klingons when we were aboard the Klothos.
They were too agreeable, too willing to co-operate. 
KIRK: Why is that unusual? They want to get out of here as much as we
do. 
SPOCK: Had I not touched them, I would have agreed with you, Captain.
But even though contact was necessarily limited and their minds were
suspicious, I picked up some indication they are planning to sabotage
the Enterprise. 
KIRK: Sabotage! How? When? 
SPOCK: I cannot say. The Klingon found near the dilithium vault knew
nothing specific. But there is some kind of sabotage in the offing. 
KIRK: They need us to get through the time barrier, if they're to get
through at all. Security, this is Captain Kirk. I want all security
teams on duty around the clock. Watch every Klingon who sets foot
aboard this ship. I don't want one of them to make a move we don't know
about.
 [Klothos Bridge]
 KOR: You have the device, Kaz? 
KAZ: By my calculations, the capsule will be triggered the exact moment
our dual ship reaches warp eight. Approximately three minutes after the
time barrier is pierced and we have disengaged, the Enterprise will
disintegrate. 
KOR: Excellent! Kali, you know what to do. Tonight they entertain us,
but the gift they will receive in return will be their destruction.
 [Rec room]
 (Devna has danced for the guests) 
KIRK: Beautifully done. 
DEVNA: I thank you, Captain. You have seen the dance of Orion women
before? 
KIRK: Many times. 
DEVNA: I wish 
KIRK: Yes? 
DEVNA: I wish I could return through the time barrier and see Orion
again. 
KIRK: You could go. We're willing to take passengers. 
DEVNA: No. You see, we have all seen the futility of attempting to
escape. Once each of us dreamed of breaking free. Then we came to
understand it could not be done, and we accepted our life here. 
KIRK: We believe it can be done. 
DEVNA: Then I shall not interfere with your dream, Captain. 
KAZ: Get away from here, human. This is my woman. 
MCCOY: Now just a minute. All I did was ask her to dance. She didn't
have to say yes. 
KIRK: Bones! 
(Kaz draws a weapon) 
XERIUS: Stop! 
(The weapon doesn't work) 
XERIUS: Ship captains and these two will come to the Council Chamber
now to face charges. 
(Meanwhile, Kali places the little capsule by some computer equipment
behind a screen)
 [Council chamber]
 XERIUS: You know any form of violence is forbidden
here. Your man began the fight and attempted to kill. I propose we
freeze the Klothos and its crew for a star century. 
KIRK: May I speak? 
XERIUS: You may. 
KIRK: Captain Kor and I were preparing to attempt an escape from here
tomorrow. If you hibernate the Klothos, you will not only be punishing
them but us. We cannot leave as a single ship. I urge you to permit our
dual ship to depart tomorrow as scheduled. 
XERIUS: Getting back to your own time continuum is that important to
you? 
KIRK: Yes. 
XERIUS: You will fail. 
KIRK: We must try, Xerius. Elysia is, in many respects, a perfect
society. But with all its virtues, it is not home. And home, with all
its faults, is where we prefer to be. 
XERIUS: You would take these renegades with you? 
KIRK: We need them. 
XERIUS: Very well. I release Captain Kor into your custody. Good luck
to you, Captain Kirk. You will be needing it.
 [Bridge]
 (The countdown starts at 10) 
KIRK: Ready to accelerate to warp six. 
SULU: Ready, sir. 
KIRK: Three, two, one. Accelerate.
 [Council chamber]
 MAGEN: No! The Klingons have hidden an explosive
aboard the Enterprise. She will be destroyed. 
XERIUS: Enterprise, this is Xerius! Come in, Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Warp seven, Captain. 
UHURA: Sir, Xerius is calling us. He says it's urgent. 
KIRK: On audio, Lieutenant. 
XERIUS [OC]: Captain Kirk! The Klingons have placed and explosive in
your computer room. Magen says it is located in the warp control panel.
 [Council chamber]
 XERIUS: It will go off when you reach warp eight.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Spock. Scotty.
 [Klothos Bridge]
 KAZ: Approaching warp eight, sir. 
KOR: The barrier.
 [Computer room]
 SCOTT: There it is, sir. 
(Spock grabs it, runs to a waste disposal chute and ejects the
explosive. Enterprise and Klothos emerge into normal space and
separate. There is a big bang, but the Enterprise is still there)
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Captain Kirk, I'm picking up a radio
transmission Captain Kor intended for his home base. He took full
credit for our escape from Elysia. 
MCCOY: Why, that scoundrel. 
KIRK: It doesn't matter, Bones. 
UHURA: It doesn't? 
KIRK: That's what matters.

Element
The
Ambergris Element
Stardate:
5499.9
Original Airdate: 1 Dec, 1973
 
Captain's log, stardate 5499.9. We are orbiting the planet Argo. Argo
was once a land planet, but it's surface is now almost completely
covered by water. The change was caused by violent seismic
disturbances. Our mission is to study the effects which the quakes and
other phenomena had on its surface. This knowledge may save millions of
lives on a Federation planet identical to Argo which will soon be
undergoing similar transformation.
 [Shuttlecraft]
 (A special shuttlecraft modeled on a catamaran has
been launched from Enterprise and landed on the ocean) 
KIRK: This is the largest land mass on the planet, isn't it, Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. The others are mere outcroppings. They suggest the
peaks of submerged mountains. 
MCCOY: I suggest that we get these seawater and algae specimens.
They're the least of the lot. 
SPOCK: For once I agree with you, Doctor. The more informative
specimens will come from the sea bottom. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Clayton, open the hatch and let our two scientists
here get on with their business. 
CLAYTON: Aye, sir. 
MCCOY: What's that? 
(Something with huge tentacles picks up the shuttlecraft and throws it
away) 
KIRK: Phasers on stun, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Firing, Captain. 
(The creature retreats below the surface) 
MCCOY: What the devil was that thing? 
SPOCK: Apparently a life form which previous surveys have not recorded.

KIRK: Let's get a closer look at it before the phaser stun wears off.
Submerge, Lieutenant. 
CLAYTON: Aye, sir. 
(They descend through the green water to the sea bed) 
MCCOY: Dual respiratory system. Lungs and gills. 
SPOCK: Its skeleton is similar to that of a Denebian whale, Captain. 
(The shuttlecraft gets slapped across the sea bed) 
KIRK: It's regaining consciousness. Surface, Mister Clayton. 
CLAYTON: Aye, sir. 
(The shuttlecraft is chased along the surface) 
KIRK: Spock, prepare to fire phasers. 
SPOCK: Phasers do not respond, Captain. We must have sustained damage
to the power pack when the creature struck us. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Emergency. 
SCOTT [OC]: Enterprise. What is it, sir. 
KIRK: We're under attack. Beam us aboard, Scotty. 
(But the sea monster bites the shuttlecraft then throws it against
rocks. McCoy falls into the water, followed by Clayton. Spock and Kirk
are unconscious in the craft) 
SCOTT [OC]: We've lost contact, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: Repeat, we've lost contact. Come in,
Captain. Come in. 
(The monster grabs the shuttlecraft and takes it underwater)
 Ship's log, stardate 5504.2. Lieutenant Commander
Scott in command. Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock have been
missing for almost five days. Search parties can find no trace of them
or the aqua-shuttle. Doctor McCoy and I are continuing the search at a
greater distance from the attack point.
 [Boat]
 MCCOY: There's nothing. There's just nothing. 
CLAYTON: I see some rocks. They're just above sea level, about two
miles away. There's something on them.
 [Rocks]
 (It's the aqua-shuttle, mangled and smashed.
Nearby, Kirk and Spock are lying face down in the water) 
MCCOY: Maybe they're still alive. 
(They pull them out of the water) 
MCCOY: Their bodies are functioning. Metabolism, heart. Everything but
the lungs. 
KIRK: Can't breathe. Suffocating. Help. Can't breathe. 
(He lifts a webbed hand to his throat) 
SCOTT: What happened to them, Doctor? What is it? 
MCCOY: Something's changed their whole lung structure. They can't live
in the air anymore.
 Medical log, stardate 5506.2. Captain Kirk and
First Office Spock were rescued forty eight hours ago. They have no
recollection of what happened to them after they were attacked, but
medical examinations show and unidentified substance in the bloodstream
has affected their entire metabolism and changed them into
water-breathers. Their internal structure is completely transformed,
and even their eyes are covered with a transparent film like the second
eyelid of a fish. So far all efforts to return them to normal have
failed.
 [Aquarium]
 (Kirk and Spock are in water, Scott and McCoy the
other side of the glass) 
MCCOY: We're stumped, Jim. The hormone seems to be the major factor in
your mutation, but we just can't identify it. 
KIRK: Are you sure the mutation wasn't somehow accomplished naturally? 
MCCOY: It was infused into your bodies at key structural points. It had
to be done by injection. 
KIRK: But can't you duplicate it, Bones? Your medical computers have
information on every procedure in the Federation's hospitals. 
MCCOY: It's highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us. 
SPOCK: That implies there are intelligent life forms on Argo. 
MCCOY: The sensors don't indicate any life forms down there, aside from
fish. 
SPOCK: They did fail to indicate the large marine creature that
attacked us. Perhaps the readings are incomplete, blocked by underwater
pressure forces. Oceans are less turbulent at greater depth. Such
conditions would be more suitable to intelligent forms. 
MCCOY: Well, we can't do much underwater exploration without the
aqua-shuttle. Our equipment is too limited. 
KIRK: We aren't limited. We can go wherever we want in that ocean. 
MCCOY: It's too risky, Jim. Argo's almost totally unexplored. You'd be
out of contact range, unarmed. 
KIRK: I have to, Bones. Look at this place. A tank. I can't command a
ship from inside an aquarium. I can't live in here. 
MCCOY: I know what you're saying, Jim, but if you go down on that
planet and you die there 
KIRK: Right now we have only two choices. Live in an aquarium somewhere
for the rest of our lives or stay on Argo. I won't accept either one of
them. 
MCCOY: What about you, Spock? What does your logic tell you? 
SPOCK: The Captain states the case emotionally, of course, but
correctly. I would be of little value to this ship if I am confined to
a tank in Sickbay. I must accompany the Captain. 
KIRK: An intelligence that can produce this kind of mutation can change
us back. We've got to find it, Bones. It must be there.
 [Boat]
 KIRK: We'll make contact as soon as possible,
Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir. 
(Kirk and Spock remove their aqua-lungs and dive into the ocean)
 [Sea bed]
 (A group of Aquans are gathering food when they
see the uniformed and booted humans swimming towards them. Aquans are
green, with gills and dark green fins across their heads, the sides of
their necks and chests) 
MALE: Go away, air breathers. You're not wanted here. 
KIRK: We won't harm you. We're friends. 
FEMALE: Leave us. It is enough our young saved your lives once. If you
go on, nothing will save you again. 
KIRK: Wait. Listen. 
MALE: Go away. 
(The Aquans leave) 
KIRK: I don't understand. They said they'd saved us once. 
SPOCK: I believe the phrase was, 'our young saved your lives once.' 
KIRK: Yes, and they didn't seem to approve. The answer appears to be in
that direction, Spock. 
SPOCK: I would say so, Captain. The instinctive reaction of all
frightened creatures is to retreat to a place of safety. 
(They descend into the rift in the seabed, and follow a tunnel to) 
SPOCK: Fascinating. And beautiful. 
KIRK: An undersea civilisation capable of fantastic architecture.
Medical triumphs unheard of in our galaxy. Why should they be afraid of
us, Spock? 
SPOCK: It is quite possible, Captain, that they find us grotesque and
ugly. And many people fear beings different from themselves. 
KIRK: Well, speculation isn't much help. We have to get in there. 
SPOCK: Perhaps there is a way open on the far side. There is much less
activity there. 
(On the other side of the city) 
KIRK: That building in the centre. It seems to be important. 
(Then they are caught in a net)
 [Chamber]
 These are the spies, Tribune. Air-breathers. 
DOMAR: You stand before the Ruling Tribunal of the Aquans. I am Domar,
the High Tribune. 
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my first
officer, Mister Spock. 
DOMAR: You are air-breather enemies from the surface. We have expected
spies for a long time. 
SPOCK: We came here in peace, Tribune. 
CADMAR: The ancient records warn that air-breathers never come in
peace. 
RILA: They came without weapons. 
MALE: Can we do nothing without consulting the ancient records? 
CADMAR: Why do the Junior Tribunes wish always to change the records? 
DOMAR: Let the mesh be removed, but stand ready. 
MALE: The surgo-op was excellent. They have mutated perfectly. 
KIRK: Your scientists induced these mutations? 
DOMAR: We do not wish to kill, even air-breathers. Your memory was
eradicated so you could not return here. 
CADMAR: It would seem their ancient records are as well preserved as
ours. They found us again to come among us as spies. 
RILA: You do not give them a chance to defend themselves, Cadmar. 
DOMAR: Rila is correct. You may speak. 
KIRK: We are visitors to your planet. We come from another world. 
RILA: You do not live on the surface places? 
SPOCK: Not on this world. 
CADMAR: Enough! Clearly, this is a lie. The air-breathers have come
again to destroy us. 
SPOCK: You are mistaken, sir. Our only purpose here is to find the
means of reversing our mutations. 
DOMAR: That is impossible. Only Aquan mutation is designated by the
surgo-records.
 [Boat]
 MCCOY [OC]: Enterprise to Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Scott here. What is it, Doctor? 
MCCOY: Sensors just gave us an update reading, Scotty. There's a
seaquake due in that area, a bad one. Complete topography changes. 
SCOTT: How soon?
 [Bridge]
 MCCOY: Within four hours. When are Jim and Spock
due to make contact? 
SCOTT [OC]: About the same time. 
MCCOY: Can you contact them sooner? 
SCOTT [OC]: We can try like blue blazes. Scott out.
 [Boat]
 SCOTT: Their directional marker indicates they
descended toward that fern bed.
 [Underwater]
 (As the hull of the boat passes overhead) 
FEMALE: Air-breathers. We must inform the Tribunes.
 [Chamber]
 KIRK: The name of our starship is on the
aqua-shuttle. If you want proof, examine the wreckage. 
RILA: Yes. Let us examine the wreckage before we make judgement. 
FEMALE: We have news, High Tribune. 
DOMAR: Speak it. 
FEMALE: Three air-breathers have invaded the sea foliage. We saw them
as we gathered edibles. 
DOMAR: Do you still believe these creatures came in peace? 
RILA: We do not know what to believe. 
DOMAR: Take these spies to the surface boulders and leave them there.
It is justice enough for our enemies.
 {Rocks]
 (Spock and Kirk are pinned under a net, near the
aqua-shuttle remains) 
RILA: Conserve your strength. I will free you. The mesh is too strong. 
KIRK: Go to the big island. Bring assistance party.
 [Boat]
 (Scott has been diving) 
CLAYTON: Did you see anything? 
SCOTT: Not a sign of them. Wait a minute. Who are 
RILA: Follow me. Your friends need help.
 [Rocks]
 RILA: There. 
SCOTT: Quick, lads. 
(Spock and Kirk are freed and back in the water) 
SCOTT: Stand by in the scouter-gig, Lieutenant.
 [Underwater]
 (Scott is protected by a personal force field) 
KIRK: Rila, this is my engineering officer, Mister Scott. Tribune Rila
is an Aquan. Their city is a short distance away. 
SCOTT: We're obliged for your help. Captain, we've been trying to
contact you for two hours. There's a sea bottom quake due. It'll
destroy this whole area. 
RILA: There are legends of such a happening. It destroyed the ancient
knowledge and caused the great surface places to sink into the sea. 
SPOCK: That suggests your race evolved from its ancient enemies. 
RILA: We did not evolve, Mister Spock. When the surface places began to
sink, many air-breathers were mutated through surgo-op, just as you
were. As the centuries passed, the mutations became hereditary. 
KIRK: Strange that such a highly developed race would be violent. 
SPOCK: Apparently they were exposed to a frightening geological
disaster. Such hardship induces savagery and violence. 
RILA: They hunted and killed us. We feared they would contaminate us
with their violence. That is also why it is forbidden to mutate back to
surface forms. 
KIRK: Then reverse mutation is possible. 
RILA: There are legends of sealed places in the sunken ruins where many
knowledge records of it are kept. 
(The seabed shakes) 
SCOTT: There's not much time, Captain. The quake's due in less than two
hours. 
KIRK: How far are the ruins, Rila? 
RILA: Only a short distance. 
KIRK: Those old records may hold the key to reversing our mutations.
We've got to find them before it's too late. 
RILA: I cannot take you to the ruins. It is against ordainments. 
KIRK: It's important, Rila. Not just for us. The population of another
planet is threatened by surface changes, too. Argo's ancient knowledge
can help save them. 
RILA: Yes. I will take you as far as the reef barrier.
 [Barrier]
 RILA: The ruins lie that way. Now, take care. The
tides are strong. 
(She leaves. Kirk and Spock are pulled along by the current)
 [Ruins]
 SPOCK: Fascinating. Obviously, an entire portion
of the continental shelf sank within a few minutes. This may be the
sealed place Rila mentioned. I believe this is an entrance panel,
Captain. 
(They swim down a staircase) 
KIRK: There's another chamber.
 [Chamber]
 (A room in the Roman style, with canisters and
equipment including a caduceus) 
SPOCK: This resembles ancient medical symbols, Captain. The torso
indicates mutation. 
KIRK: That's it, Spock. The key to the survival of the race. 
(They grab a couple of canisters each and swim for it. But they
encounter Mister Tentacles, the sea monster. Fortunately another quake
hits, and it gets buried under a collapsed building)
 [Aquarium]
 (McCoy has got the scrolls out of the canisters) 
MCCOY: If the universal translator is right, the substance in your
bloodstream is similar to the ambergris of Earth whales. Reverse
mutation is induced by infusion of an antitoxin, concentrated doses of
it. 
KIRK: What's the composition of the antitoxin, Bones? 
MCCOY: It's made from the venom of the Argo sur-snake.
 [Underwater]
 KIRK: To capture a sur-snake, we need your help.
Our people can't descend to that depth. 
NEPHRO: Domar has warned that if we break more ordainments, we will be
exiled to the open seas. 
SPOCK: We cannot reverse our mutations without the serum, nor can the
Aquans benefit from the knowledge of their ancestors. 
NEPHRO: But the ordainments state clearly that capturing sur-snakes is
forbidden. 
MALE: Ordainments are useless in times of turbulence. Only knowledge
will help us. 
RILA: Nephro, we must break the ordainments.
 [Ruins]
 (They net the monster that was caught by the
falling ruins) 
RILA: Quickly, Captain. 
(They milk it's venom while another quake strikes) 
RILA: Quickly, we must leave. 
KIRK: We need more venom. 
RILA: No, no, there is no time. 
(This time the monster is totally squashed by falling masonry)
 [Aquarium]
 (McCoy and Chapel are in the water too) 
MCCOY: We have prepared an antitoxin from the venom of the sur-snake,
but a part of the old records is missing, so the exact dosage is
unknown. Experiments on fish show that if the antitoxin is too strong,
it causes over-mutation, which cannot be reversed by any means. We're
running out of venom, so conclusive experiments are impossible. I
decreased the strength by three quarters, Jim, but we can't be sure
it's right. 
KIRK: How many infusions, Bones? 
MCCOY: Two small, one large. 
KIRK: Well, let's get started. 
(McCoy injects Kirk, who turns red then white) 
MCCOY: His pulse is fading. (turns pink again) Pulse and heart normal.
Something's happening to his metabolism. It's at least ten times normal
speed. (the webbing between his fingers disappears) Metabolism normal.
Heartbeat normal. The lungs are beginning to revert. This is the last
dose, the largest infusion. (he grows scales) The antitoxin was too
strong. (The scales vanish) He's starting to breathe. Quick, get him
out of the tank! 
(Outside) 
MCCOY: How do you feel, Jim? 
KIRK: A little dizzy. Otherwise normal. 
MCCOY: Well, better get into some dry clothes. I wouldn't want you to
catch cold. Your turn, Spock.
 [Bridge]
 (Domar and Rila are wearing aqualungs) 
KIRK: We'll bombard the unpopulated pressure areas with phaser beams
and change the epicentre of the quake so it won't endanger your people
or your city. 
DOMAR: I did not believe such knowledge was possible. 
SCOTT: Major tremors will start in three minutes, Captain. 
DOMAR: It is incredible. All of it. 
KIRK: Confirm co-ordinates, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Confirmed, sir. 
KIRK: Fire phasers as directed, gentlemen. 
AREX: Aye, aye, sir. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate the epicentre of the quake was in the north
polar seas, Captain, a totally uninhabited area. 
DOMAR: Then our people are safe. 
KIRK: When can we beam down, Spock? 
SPOCK: The seabed should stabilize within a few hours.
 [Shoreline]
 SPOCK: Argo appears to have a new city, Captain,
or rather, one reborn. 
RILA: Our people survived the seaquakes with little damage, thanks to
your help. 
DOMAR: We owe you and your friends much gratitude, Captain Kirk. We
will try to repay by making the ancient records available for your
studies. 
SPOCK: Our experience here has shown us the means of diverting quakes.
That will mean much to the endangered Federation planet. 
RILA: The light is warm and the air is soft. I shall be glad when the
surface places can be inhabited. 
DOMAR: The young Aquans have decided to rebuild the great shelters of
the air-breathers. 
KIRK: Only the young Aquans? 
DOMAR: Senior Aquans cannot adjust to the thought of becoming
air-breathers. We will remain at the Aqua City. 
KIRK: Don't lose contact with each other like your ancestors. 
DOMAR: We will pass ordainments to forbid it. 
RILA: And we, this time, will not ignore them.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - The Slaver Weapon
The
Slaver Weapon
Stardate:
4187.3
Original Airdate: 15 Dec, 1973
 First
Officer's log, stardate 4187.3. The Enterprise shuttlecraft Copernicus
is en route to Starbase Two Five with an important cargo. A Slaver
stasis box discovered by archaeologists on the planet Kzin.
 [Shuttlecraft]
 SPOCK: These stasis boxes are the most remarkable
thing the Slavers ever produced. Time stands still inside a stasis box.
A billion years means nothing in there. What is it, Lieutenant?
UHURA: I've studied the history of the Slaver Empire, but it's sketchy.
We know they were masters of all the intelligent beings in this galaxy
a billion years ago, until one race revolted. Are the stasis boxes the
only source of information we have?
SPOCK: The Slavers and all their subjects were exterminated in the war
that followed. Intelligent life had to evolve all over again. The
stasis boxes are the only remnant of those lost civilisations.
UHURA: Why is it glowing like that?
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, what is our position?
SULU: Passing Beta Lyrae, sir. One forty two degrees north east of
galactic plane.
SPOCK: Most peculiar. This indicates there is another stasis box
circling Beta Lyrae.
UHURA: Another one?
SPOCK: It would be most illogical that a stasis box would remain here
undiscovered for so long. Beta Lyrae is one of the rare spectacles of
the galaxy. Almost every ship that passes stops to see it.
UHURA: Maybe no one else was carrying a stasis box detector.
SPOCK: Possible. The only known stasis box detector is another stasis
box. Still. Mister Sulu.
SULU: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: Bring us about. We'll investigate the Beta Lyrae system.
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.
 SPOCK [OC]: Stasis boxes and their contents are
the only remnant of a species which ruled most of this galaxy a billion
years ago. Their effect on science has been incalculable. In one was
found a flying belt which was the key to the artificial gravity field
used by starships. Another box contained a disrupter bomb with the pin
pulled. As a result, all stasis boxes are now under the jurisdiction of
Starfleet, and only certain key specialists handle them. The boxes are
rare, potentially dangerous, and we seem to have found a second one.
 [Planet surface]
 (Spock, Sulu and Uhura are wearing life-support
belts. Spock carries the box)
UHURA: I never did like these little ice-bound worlds.
SPOCK: We are not tourists here, Lieutenant.
SULU: Mister Spock, if it takes a stasis box to find another stasis
box, how did anyone ever find the first one?
SPOCK: As with a number of discoveries, purely by accident, Lieutenant.
The other box seems to be almost under us, perhaps thirty metres below
the ice.
SULU: We won't have any trouble digging for it. In this low pressure,
the ice should boil as soon as the phasers melt it.
(But they are not alone. Sulu gets shot, then Uhura, then Spock)
 SPOCK [OC]: I must take full responsibility for
this event. Instead of being warned by the highly unlikely coincidence
of a second stasis box, I allowed it's possible value to influence my
judgement. The Kzinti now possess our stasis box. Its contents will
determine how much damage my error has done the Federation and its
people.
 [Kzinti Ship]
 UHURA: Where are we?
SPOCK: A Kzinti spacecraft.
SULU: That isn't good. Kzinti aren't supposed to have phasers, are
they?
SPOCK: The Treaty of Sirius does not permit them any weapons at all,
beyond police vessels. Obviously, the treaty has been broken.
SULU: A police web. We won't be able to move unless we can turn it off
somehow.
(A group of cats in spacesuits enter)
SPOCK: The lean, be-draggles one is a reader of minds.
UHURA: I've heard all Kzinti telepaths are unhappy neurotics. He fits
the description.
SPOCK: There is no sure way to guard our thoughts from him. Mister
Sulu, he is not likely to deal with me or Lieutenant Uhura. She and I
are inferior beings to them. But the Kzinti are meat eaters. If you
sense him reading your mind, think of eating a raw vegetable.
SULU: Yes, sir. Maybe I can goad them into revealing their purpose.
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura. This may be crucial. In the presence of the
Kzinti, do not say anything, do not do anything startling. Try to look
harmless.
UHURA: Any special reason?
SPOCK: Are you forgetting Kzinti females are dumb animals? In an
emergency the Kzinti may forget a human female is an intelligent
creature.
UHURA: Thanks. Thanks a lot.
SPOCK: Lieutenant, I value your intelligence, but we may be able to
seize an opportunity to escape if the Kzinti believe you have none.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Identify yourself.
SULU: Lieutenant Sulu of the Starfleet vessel Enterprise. This is First
Officer Spock.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: You're a Vulcan. I feel no pressing need to talk to an
eater of
roots and leaves. Humans at least are omnivorous. I am Chuft-Captain.
You are prisoners aboard the privateer Traitor's Claw, a stolen police
vessel.
SULU: Stealing must be a habit with you. This ship, two stasis boxes.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Kzinti archaeologists found both boxes, but the one we
managed
to keep was empty. It served us well as bait to draw you here, but the
Slavers had weapons that could devastate a galaxy. There could be one
in that box.
SULU: The Kzinti fought four wars with humankind and lost all of them.
The last one was two hundred years ago, and you haven't learned a thing
since.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Guard your speech. None of my crew has yet tasted human
meat as
our ancestors did. We would welcome the opportunity. Always you have
had superior equipment. We seek a weapon that will defeat you at last.
SULU: Then you're really working for the Kzinti government.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: The records will show the Traitor's Claw is a stolen
police
ship. If we are captured, the Highest of Kzin will repudiate us. But if
we succeed, you are meat for our tables.
(They fire a beam at the stasis box, then open it. Chuft removes a
picture of a one-eyed green crocodile standing on it's hind legs)
SULU: Could that be a picture of a Slaver?
SPOCK: If so, it is the first ever discovered. An important historical
find.
(There are other things in the box)
UHURA: It looks like fresh meat. Over a billion years in that box, and
it looks fresh.
(Then, a green pistol-shaped thing)
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Nothing like this has ever been found. We are the only
ones who
have it. Look at it, human. This weapon may well mean the end of
mankind.
 First Officer's log, supplemental. The Kzinti now
possess a weapon potentially deadly to the entire galaxy. The extent of
its power remains to be seen.
 [Kzinti ship]
 CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Have the humans moved to the
surface and be
sure they're secured in the police web. We will use them to test the
weapon.
FLYER: Yes, Chuft-Captain.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: You have observed the aliens. Can you read their minds?
TELEPATH: I can read Sulu with difficulty, Chuft-Captain. The other
human is only a female. The third is a pacifistic herbivore. Surely you
would not force me to delve such minds?
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: If it is necessary. I realise the time you need to
recover from
each effort.
 [Planet surface]
 KZIN 5 [OC]: Chuft-Captain, we have finished testing
the meat that was in the stasis box. It is protoplasmic and poisonous.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: What of the picture?
TELEPATH: The human, Sulu, believes it to be a Slaver.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: So do I. It would have made a worthy enemy.
(He tries the weapon, but nothing happens)
FLYER: Perhaps the toggle.
(The weapon glows, then changes to a more pointed shape. Chuft-Captain
tries it
again. Still nothing)
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Telepath! Am I not affecting him at all? Is it the life
support
belt interfering?
TELEPATH: No, Chuft-Captain. He hears a faint whine, but he feels no
ill effects. There is a vibration in the metal of his belt.
Chuft-Captain, he is too alien. He makes me taste yellow root munched
between
flat teeth.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Be glad if you need not read the Vulcan's mind. It may
be a
communications device, or a sonic stunner designed to affect members of
a race now dead.
(He changes its shape again)
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: A good serviceable telescope. They built well, these
Slavers.
FLYER: It is of no use to us. We already have small telescopes.
(Another shape change, and this time it does fire a beam)
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: I give you credit, human. You are not afraid to die.
SULU: Merely a laser. The Federation has had a more effective model for
over one hundred years.
(Another shape change, and the device becomes a hand-held rocket,
pulling Chuft-Captain along with it. He knocks Uhura off the web, and
she
tiptoes away. Meanwhile, Chuft hits the telepath)
KZIN 4: Telepath's suit has ruptured.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Never mind that. The female is escaping!
KZIN 4: What of it?
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Fool! Human females are intelligent.
(So Uhura gets shot and put back on the web)
FLYER: Telepath's suit lost considerable pressure. We reached the ship
in time to save him.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Good. We will need him later. What is this?
FLYER: Perhaps a personal rocket motor. One could place one's foot on
the pedals and balance. It appears to be transportation, not a weapon.
SULU: Nice try.
UHURA: I'm slowing down. I used to run the hundred in record time. How
long was I out? Did I miss much?
SULU: Not much. A lot of good they'll get out of that rocket setting.
SPOCK: We are fortunate none of the settings so far have been superior
to the technology now available to the Federation.
UHURA: Uh oh.
(Now the weapon is a ball with loops sticking out on either side)
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: No gun sight. No obvious was to aim it.
(So he holds it at arms length. Behind him, the lights go out in the
cavern where their ship is parked)
UHURA: Mister Spock, I can move.
SULU: So can I. The police web is off.
SPOCK: The fifth setting seems to be an energy absorber. Fascinating. I
had no idea the Slavers had such things.
SULU: Mister Spock, we
SPOCK: Yes. When I give the word, make for the shuttle. Remember to
zigzag. Ready? Go.
(Sulu and Uhura run, while Spock jumps the Kzinti and grabs the weapon
before following. Uhura gets shot again)
FLYER: Chuft-Captain, what happened?
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: I would rather not discuss it. Help me into the ship.
SULU: (hiding) Mister Spock! I thought it was one of the aliens.
SPOCK: I have the weapon.
SULU: They've got Uhura, and subspace radio. They can call for help
from the Kzin planet if they think the weapon's worth it.
SPOCK: No, they cannot. Or rather, will not.
SULU: Why?
SPOCK: Because I kicked Chuft-Captain. Consider. Chuft-Captain has been
attacked by an herbivorous pacifist, an eater of leaves and roots. One
who traditionally does not fight. And the ultimate insult, I left him
alive. Chuft-Captain's honour is at stake. He must seek personal
revenge before he can call for help.
SULU: That gives us some time. You did plan it that way?
SPOCK: Of course.
SULU: As long as you stay free, the Kzinti can't or won't do anything.
But they could use Lieutenant Uhura as a bribe.
SPOCK: Agreed. However, to this point, we have not seen anything more
powerful than equipment Starfleet already has.
SULU: Yes. But I have a feeling, Mister Spock. This weapon must have
belonged to a spy, an espionage agent.
SPOCK: I acknowledge your expertise in the field of weapons, Mister
Sulu, but I do not see how you can determine probable ownership.
SULU: Well, here, look at it. All these settings. We don't know a
common Slaver soldier couldn't handle them, but as a weapon, only the
laser is effective. The others aren't necessary for the line soldier's
one purpose, to destroy the enemy.
SPOCK: Assuming it's a spy weapon then, the Slavers would have wanted
to keep it a secret weapon. If so, it is logical to assume it has a
self-destruct setting too.
SULU: But we've seen all the phases.
SPOCK: Perhaps not. There is the null setting. It seems to do nothing.
But why should it be there? It does not correspond to a safety lock.
(He pushes the toggle back up to the top, and it turns into a globe
with a handle)
SULU: It may be the key to another setting.
(The Kzinti ship takes off through the ice)
 [Kzinti ship]
 CHUFT-CAPTAIN: This is the Traitor's Claw calling
Mister
Sulu.
 [Planet surface]
 CHUFT-CAPTAIN [OC]: We have the female prisoner.
Will you
bargain, or must we take harsh action? It will not be pleasant for her.
I repeat. We have the female prisoner as hostage. You have something we
want. We will trade her life for the Slaver weapon.
SPOCK: Answer him, Lieutenant.
SULU: Lieutenant Sulu here. What about Mister Spock?
CHUFT-CAPTAIN [OC]: He must surrender. I will offer him single combat.
SULU: Not interested.
 [Kzinti ship]
 CHUFT-CAPTAIN: I am as the Vulcan left me, with
two ribs
broken. I have not set them nor bandaged myself. He may conceivably
kill me.
 [Planet surface]
 SPOCK: Kzinti ribs have some vertical bracing. But
I kicked him over one heart. I compute the odds of my defeating
Chuft-Captain in combat at sixteen to one against.
SULU: Offer refused.
 [Kzinti ship]
 CHUFT-CAPTAIN: They think very little of you.
UHURA: Wrong. They don't think much of you.
 [Planet surface]
 (Sulu turns the globe, and it becomes more
weapon-like)
SPOCK: A self-destruct mechanism would not have a gun sight.
SULU: No. Let's see what this does do.
(He points it at the horizon, and there is a massive explosion)
SULU: We can't give them that!
SPOCK: Fascinating. No world in the Federation has produced anything so
powerful. Almost beyond theoretical limits. Total conversion of matter
to energy at a distance.
SULU: If the Kzinti had that, the whole galaxy would be their dinner
table.
(The eruption caused by his firing of the weapon is continuing)
SULU: Hit the dirt!
(The wind from the blast hits them, knocking them over. Sulu drops the
weapon, and it turns back into a globe)
 [Kzinti ship]
 (Spock, Sulu and Uhura are on the police web while
Chuft-Captain plays with the globe. It forms another new shape)
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: What would this be?
FLYER: I have no idea. It is generating power.
SPOCK: There is a grid. It may be another communications device. But
that seems redundant.
(The device starts beeping)
SULU: It has the Kzinti frightened.
SPOCK: The Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their owners.
UHURA: Could it be a voice-activated mechanism?
SPOCK: No, it appears to be conversing with them. A reasoning computer
that small?
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: How long has it been since you were turned off?
WEAPON: I do not know. When I am off, I have no sense of passing time.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: What is the last thing you remember?
WEAPON: We were on a mission. I may not tell you of it unless you know
certain code words.
FLYER: If you could describe the positions of the stars in your
sector, we would know how much time has passed since then.
WEAPON: Without certain code words, I may not describe our location.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: One of the settings on this weapon was a total
conversion beam.
We saw it. Tell us how to find it.
WEAPON: Twist me widdershins until you reach the null position. Then
SULU: They've got it.
UHURA: There must be something we can do.
SPOCK: Most peculiar.
(The weapon is a different shape entirely, with two large prongs. The
Kzinti leave with it)
SPOCK: That was not the total conversion beam setting.
 [Planet surface]
 CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Like others, this form seems to
possess no
gun sight.
FLYER: It may be a broad-beam weapon, for use only from orbit. We saw
its power. I suggest you fire at a very distant target.
CHUFT-CAPTAIN: Very well.
 [Kzinti ship]
 UHURA: We can't let them have that weapon.
SPOCK: They are not about to get it, Lieutenant.
UHURA: Why not?
SPOCK: Assume you are a Slaver war computer. You've been turned off.
You do not know for how long, but when you were turned off, there was a
war on. Now you are awakened by aliens you never saw before. They do
not know any of the military passwords. They ask you so many questions
it is obvious they know little about you. Your owner is nowhere about.
What would you think?
UHURA: I'd think I'd been captured by the enemy. Or an enemy, at least.
SULU: And when they asked you how to find your most powerful weapon
setting, what would you give them?
(Outside, Chuft-Captain pulls the trigger. KaBOOM! There is a crater
where he
was standing and part of the ship's hull has been blown away)
SPOCK: Activate life support belts.
UHURA: A disrupter field.
SPOCK: Yes. Another conventional weapon. It appears the total
conversion beam was the only thing the Slavers had that we do not.
 [Planet surface]
 SULU: No sign of the weapon, of course. It would
have looked nice in some museum.
SPOCK: It never would have reached the museum, Lieutenant. There was
too much power in that one setting. If not the Kzinti, the Klingons or
some other species would have tried to possess it.
 [Shuttlecraft]
 SPOCK: Strange, how the past sometimes breaks
through into the present. That ancient war could have sparked a new war
between man and Kzinti.
UHURA: Didn't you say the Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by
their dead owners?
SPOCK: Yes, an ancient superstition.
UHURA: At this rate, they'll never get over those old superstitions.

Stardate:
5501.2
Original Airdate: 5 Jan, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 5501.2. We are orbiting the planet Lactra
Seven. Our mission is to discover the whereabouts or fate of a six
member science crew. Voice contact having yielded nothing, a landing
party beamed aboard to see if the deserted ship's log and computers
could give us any information.
 [Briefing room]
 MARKEL [on monitor]: It is now thirty two minutes
since our last contact with the three members of our crew on the planet
surface. As the senior officer aboard, I, Lieutenant Commander Markel,
have made the following decision. The three remaining crew members,
myself included, will beam down to effect a rescue. If, for any reason,
we do not return, be it known that 
KIRK: It was against all orders. 
MCCOY: The need was apparently desperate. 
KIRK: The Captain of a ship, no matter his rank, must follow the book. 
SPOCK: A capability, I'm afraid, out of the reach of most humans. 
MCCOY: You Vulcans are the most impossible, unimaginative 
KIRK: Bones, that's not helping the situation. 
MCCOY: Sorry, Jim. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, what can we expect to find on Lactra Seven? 
SPOCK: It's a class M planet, gravity Earth normal, atmosphere Earth
normal. There is no previous information available except that which
the survey ship logged before her crew left her. 
KIRK: According to their lot, they beamed down six weeks ago. 
SPOCK: Five weeks, three days, two hours and four minutes to be exact,
Captain. 
KIRK: Careless of me, Mister Spock. Planetary life forms? 
SPOCK: It certainly can support life forms. But I cannot speculate on
what type without further data. Mister Arex is conducting a sensor scan
now. 
KIRK: It will take too long to do a comprehensive scan. I want a
landing party to at least beam down to the last known co-ordinates the
other crew used. 
MCCOY: Jim, if the others are lost, why take the risk? 
KIRK: Because they may not be dead. We have to find out. 
MCCOY: It's still a risk. 
KIRK: That's why we're here, Bones. Gentlemen, we'll travel light.
Phasers, tricorders, communicators and medical kit.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: You have the co-ordinates from the other
ship, Scotty. Put us down in the same place. 
SCOTT: Sir, Mister Arex has located a variety of life forms on the
planet. No large groups or city clusters yet. 
KIRK: Then we'll beam back up. 
SPOCK: Logical, Captain. 
KIRK: Energise, Mister Scott.
 [Planet surface]
 (It looks like marsh land. Green, with steam
rising from pools of water) 
KIRK: Everyone all right? 
MCCOY: Ten yards the other way and we'd be boiled alive. 
SPOCK: Unusual that such a lake would exist under these planetary
conditions. 
KIRK: Er, Spock. 
(A large red one-eyed monster has risen from the main body of water. It
has Big Teeth) 
SPOCK: Most remarkable. 
KIRK: It may be able to navigate on land. 
MCCOY: I know it can. 
(Big Red rushes them) 
KIRK: Phasers on stun! 
(The three beams hit it, it roars a few times then dives back
underwater) 
KIRK: Let's get out of here. 
(On an elegant rock 'bridge' formation) 
MCCOY: Not a very welcome sight, is it? 
KIRK: I'll see if I can pick up anything on my communicator. This is
Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise, calling the crew of the Ariel. Come
in please. Come in. 
MCCOY: They're answering. (static) Did you get a fix on that, Jim? 
KIRK: Yes. That way. 
MCCOY: Strange you didn't get a voice reply. 
SPOCK: There could be many reasons why we did not. 
MCCOY: Never mind counting them. 
(They cross a desert area and meet another creature, with three toes
and a blue face, which roars at them) 
KIRK: Phasers on stun! 
SPOCK: It seems to gather strength from our phasers. In my opinion. 
KIRK: Concentrate on the underside of the neck. 
(They run away, and it eventually falls over) 
SPOCK: Captain? 
KIRK: Right here. You all right? 
SPOCK: I am undamaged. Where is Doctor McCoy? 
KIRK: It came from back there. 
(McCoy is trapped under the creature's body) 
KIRK: We'll get you out, Bones. 
(Brute force is no use) 
SPOCK: It would appear a more logical solution is in order, Captain. We
don't lift the tail off, we dig the Doctor out. 
(They do) 
MCCOY: Thanks. The air was running out under there. 
KIRK: Were you hurt? 
MCCOY: No, just surprised. It isn't every day a dinosaur falls on you.
This is a pretty strange place. 
KIRK: Agreed. How much desert do we have to cross, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: One point one kilometres, sir. 
KIRK: We'd better pick up our pace. There's no place for cover if we
meet any other creatures. The bearing on the signal we heard is that
way. 
(As they walk on) 
SPOCK: Captain, the beast, did it seem familiar to you? 
KIRK: I've seen something very like it on Canopus Three, but that's
light years from here. Still, this desert area is the same as on
Canopus. 
SPOCK: You propose the same environment necessarily prompts the same
evolution? 
MCCOY: My shoes are full of sand. 
SPOCK: Doctor, your lack of scientific interest is amazing. 
MCCOY: I'll be happy to discuss that with you, Mister Spock, next time
you drop in to my medical lab. 
(At the waterside. gazing at their reflections in the still water) 
MCCOY: Oh, this seems a lot more friendly than the desert. 
SPOCK: Captain, doesn't it strike you strange that two such different
ecologies could co-exist so closely? 
KIRK: I've seen stranger things, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Merely an observation, Captain. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 
SCOTT [OC]: Enterprise. Scott here. 
KIRK: Any new information, Scotty? 
SCOTT [OC]: There is a large concentration of life forms ninety eight
point five kilometres north east of you. Apparently a city, or a
central gathering place. Nothing else yet. 
KIRK: North east. That's where we got the signal from. All right,
Scotty, keep scanning. Kirk out. 
MCCOY: I don't like it, Jim. Why only one short signal and no more? 
KIRK: I don't know. But at least they're alive. 
SPOCK: Apparently alive. We cannot be sure. 
KIRK: I choose to believe they are. 
SPOCK: Allow me to test the water first, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Go ahead, but it looks clear enough. 
SPOCK: Captain, the water is too pure. 
MCCOY: It tastes just fine. 
SPOCK: Nonetheless, it is too pure. 
KIRK: In other words, it's too good to be true. 
SPOCK: Correct, Captain. And a rain forest this close to a desert is
also illogical. It is my theory that what we have seen since we landed
was manufactured, not created. 
MCCOY: Terraforming isn't new. It implies intelligent life forms. 
KIRK: Yes, but terraforming usually follows a pattern. This seems like
random choice. 
SPOCK: Unless, of course, the random choice is the pattern. 
MCCOY: Spock, do you ever say anything straight out? 
SPOCK: I thought I just did, Doctor. 
KIRK: Gentlemen, please. We have work to do. 
SPOCK: The desperation of the science ship's first landing party is now
obvious. 
KIRK: We're still alive, aren't we? 
MCCOY: That's true. 
SPOCK: However, not exactly safe. 
(Flying creatures are approaching) 
KIRK: Phasers on full stun. 
MCCOY: They're useless. 
KIRK: No. They're like the dragons on Maravel. The stun charge should
get them. 
(They fly off) 
MCCOY: That's strange. 
SPOCK: By observation alone, it appears they hit an invisible force
field. 
KIRK: If that's true, Spock, then 
(The landing party are grabbed by the tentacles of three giant
slug-like creatures) 
MCCOY: We've been travelling for hours. Where are they taking us? 
KIRK: Towards the north-west, toward the city Scotty reported. 
SPOCK: Captain, there it is. 
(A garish lump of candy pink, red and purple surrounded by conifers) 
KIRK: That must be five square kilometres. 
SPOCK: If these are the builders, it is an admirable feat.
 [City]
 (Spock, Kirk and McCoy are deposited under a
curved purple roof, onto a blue tiled floor) 
MCCOY: They don't seem very interested in communicating with us. If
they can communicate at all. 
SPOCK: Perhaps not in a way we understand. I keep receiving
impressions. 
KIRK: Any ideas, Doctor? 
MCCOY: Well, I've got one and I definitely don't like it. I'd guess
they're doing exactly what we would do. 
KIRK: Which is? 
MCCOY: Well, if we came upon an alien creature we'd never seen before,
the first thing we'd do is to make sure it was free of harmful
bacteria. Then we'd see if it was intelligent. 
SPOCK: Congratulations, Doctor. A most logical assumption. 
KIRK: A more important question, gentlemen, is whether or not there's a
way out of here. A force field. It seems harmless enough. 
MCCOY: So do the bars of a jail, unless you're on the inside. 
KIRK: And we are definitely on the inside. 
MCCOY: Hey! Somebody! Anybody! 
SPOCK: A wasteful use of energy, Doctor. I believe they can hear you
without your shouting. 
KIRK: You said you were picking up impressions. Are the aliens
telepathic? 
SPOCK: I've come to the conclusion they are, Captain. But the speed at
which the thoughts flow is too great for me to comprehend except for
the most fleeting image. 
KIRK: Surely we can communicate with them some way. 
SPOCK: They appear to be as advanced beyond Earth civilisation as you
are from a colony of ants. 
MCCOY: Then what were all those other creatures where we beamed down? 
SPOCK: You will recall we recognised at least two species from vastly
different planets. The environment did not appear natural to this
planet. A technology this advanced could easily travel to other star
systems to collect specimens. 
MCCOY: You mean it's some kind of a zoo? 
SPOCK: Exactly. 
KIRK: They took our phasers, communicators and other equipment so they
must have some idea we're intelligent. 
SPOCK: Not necessarily, Captain. They could have taken them for the
same reason you would take a sharp object away from a child. 
MCCOY: Or maybe they want to see how our toys work. 
SPOCK: That too is a possibility. 
(The slugs return, and drag them out of the holding cell) 
MCCOY: Now wait a minute, you, you. Hey! 
KIRK: We've got to communicate with them. 
(As they are carried along past other creatures in cells) 
MCCOY: Well, so much for mythology. 
SPOCK: I find them strangely attractive. 
KIRK: Look ahead. 
(They are deposited into their own zoo compound) 
KIRK: Better do what they want for now, anyway. They activated another
force field. 
MCCOY: This is real grass. 
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. This area has been carefully prepared for human
types. The aliens are safe now. 
MCCOY: How's that? 
SPOCK: They are safe because we are now exhibits in a zoo. 
MCCOY: A zoo? I'm no animal. 
KIRK: On this planet, Bones, they seem to be the people and we are the
animals. 
MARKEL: Hello, I'm Lieutenant Commander Tom Markel. This is our
biologist, Randi Bryce. 
KIRK: James Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. First Officer Spock. Our
physician, Doctor McCoy. 
MARKEL: We've been expecting you. 
KIRK: You've what? 
BRYCE: We heard your communicator signal. 
MCCOY: Then why didn't you warn us? 
BRYCE: We couldn't warn you. They're constantly picking up our
equipment and fooling with it. 
SPOCK: Where do they keep the equipment? I could use my tricorder. 
MARKEL: No use, sir. They're on an exhibit table. Beyond the force
field. 
KIRK: There were six of you on the mission. 
MARKEL: We didn't beam down in time to save the original three. 
BRYCE: Lieutenant Randolph is in the house. She's running a high fever,
but we can't seem to do anything about it. 
MCCOY: I'll check her out. Maybe I can help. 
KIRK: What have you learned about the aliens? 
MARKEL: There's not much, sir. This is a zoo. So tremendous as to be
almost unbelievable. 
KIRK: Have you tried an escape? 
MARKEL: A dozen different ways. Tunnels, a weakness in the force field,
nothing worked. 
SPOCK: Have you tried to communicate? 
MARKEL: Yes, sir. But all we've been able to arouse in them is a sort
of quivering motion. 
KIRK: We seem to have company. 
(Two of the aliens are watching the new exhibits) 
MARKEL: They built this for us. We've concluded they're telepathic. I
guess they read our minds and came as close as they could to make it
like home. 
KIRK: Spock, try and make contact. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. I can't seem to get through, Captain. They appear too
involved with each other. 
(The aliens quiver) 
KIRK: You seem to be getting a response. 
SPOCK: My impression is that they are laughing at me. 
MARKEL: So far, Mister Spock, we haven't found anything funny in this. 
SPOCK: Animals in a zoo rarely do. 
KIRK: Let's find the others. I feel a need for human companionship.
 [House]
 (It is sparsely furnished and open plan. A woman
is lying on a mattress on the floor) 
BRYCE: Captain Kirk, Mister Spock, this is Nancy Randolph, our
navigator. 
KIRK: How is she? 
MCCOY: Without my instruments, it's difficult to make an exact
diagnosis. Rough guess is a malarial type infection caused by an insect
bite. I can't do anything without my medikit. 
KIRK: The Lactrans outside, what do they do? 
MARKEL: They appear to be guards, sir. Making sure we don't harm each
other. 
KIRK: Do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves. 
MARKEL: They bring supplies once a week. 
KIRK: Always to the same place? 
BRYCE: Yes, always, near the display case. 
KIRK: What display case? 
BRYCE: Behind this house, outside the force field. All our toys,
phasers, communicators, medical supplies. 
MCCOY: Then my equipment should be there. 
KIRK: Maybe we can get them to give them back to us. 
SPOCK: Captain, they are highly intelligent. I'm sure they are quite
aware of the purpose of each piece of equipment now. 
MCCOY: The medical kit wouldn't be harmful. It would help her, one of
their specimens. 
SPOCK: Then think about it that way, Doctor.
 [Compound]
 MARKEL: Food. But it's not feeding time. 
KIRK: They must have sensed a need and interpreted it as food. 
SPOCK: I suggest we all concentrate on the medical kit. 
(It works. An alien delicately picks up the tiny object in its tentacle
and hands it to McCoy) 
MCCOY: It's all here. They haven't damaged it. 
KIRK: What's your evaluation of the situation, Markel? 
MARKEL: They treat us quite well, sir. They seem to want us alive and
well. And they don't want to let us go. 
SPOCK: A natural reaction for the curators of a zoo. 
MARKEL: Sir, do you think there is any chance of getting out? 
KIRK: As long as we're alive, there's a chance. Tonight, I'll try and
find a weak link in the force field. 
SPOCK: Begging your pardon, Captain, I think we should face the
situation realistically. We are specimen animals in a zoo. And they
have taken every precaution to prevent our escape. To them we are caged
for life. We seem to be drawing quite a crowd. 
KIRK: Gentlemen, since they are learning from us, why don't we learn
something from them? 
MARKEL: How? We can't get through to them? 
KIRK: They communicate telepathically. 
BRYCE: Between themselves, yes, but, Mister Spock, aren't Vulcans
telepathic? 
SPOCK: To a degree, with our own species and with some others, but the
Lactran intelligence is eons beyond mine. 
KIRK: How much have you learned? 
SPOCK: About as much as a mother learns from a six month old infant. 
MCCOY: What's their impression of us? 
SPOCK: We seem to frighten the smaller ones. Some, the females, I
believe, find us quite ugly. 
MCCOY: What about the Enterprise, Jim. Scotty could get worried. He
could beam down a fighting force. 
KIRK: My orders were not to attempt a rescue under any condition. 
SPOCK: A wise move, Captain. From what I can gather, even the
Enterprise is no match for their force field. 
MCCOY: How about coming up with another move, then? 
SPOCK: If I may suggest, sir? 
KIRK: Go ahead. 
SPOCK: It is obvious they can pick up specific thought transmissions
from us if they care to go to the trouble. I suggest that one of our
number appear to be ill. The rest will put strong thoughts in our minds
that a communicator is needed for recovery. 
KIRK: Let's try it, and let's be close to the communicator when we do.
I'll pretend I'm sick. All of you concentrate. 
MARKEL: It's a little one. Could be a child. 
KIRK: Once I get my hands on a communicator, I can have Scotty beam us
all aboard the Enterprise. Ready now. 
(Kirk falls to the ground) 
SPOCK: The communicator, concentrate on the communicator. 
(It works. Baby Lactran places the communicator next to Kirk on the
ground) 
KIRK: Enterprise, this is Captain Kirk. Beam us aboard. 
(The communicator is snatched back again)
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: What in the cosmos? 
(The baby fills the transporter bay)
 [Compound]
 SPOCK: I'm receiving an impression they are
worried about their child, Captain. 
KIRK: I'm worried about the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: They seem to think you made the child disappear. They did not
know we were a deadly species, capable of injuring one of them. 
MCCOY: Well, let's not stand here. Let's do something. 
KIRK: The best thing we can do is Argh! 
MCCOY: What is it? 
KIRK: (in pain) They're in my head. What happened to the baby? What
happened? 
SPOCK: Captain, fight it. Fight it as hard as you can. They think too
fast in too complex a manner. If he gives up for even one moment, he
may go mad.
 [Bridge]
 (Baby carries Scott out of the turbolift) 
SCOTT: Everyone clear out. 
M'RESS: What's going on? 
SCOTT: I think it's harmless, but I'm not sure. 
M'RESS: What do you want us to do? 
SCOTT: Whatever it wants me to. 
(Baby puts him down) 
SCOTT: Now, supposing you and I talk this over. You can talk, can't
you? You can't talk. Well, what can you do? Oh, no! Listen, you'll send
us off into space if you
 [Compound]
 MCCOY: Jim, are you all right? 
KIRK: Yes. I think so. 
SPOCK: Captain, they have concluded they cannot break through your mind
on a one to one basis. They are now gathering the mental strength of
all five of them to break through. 
KIRK: I can't hold out against that many. 
SPOCK: Everybody, concentrate on Captain Kirk. Form a thought screen. 
KIRK: No. No! Let me alone! Please! They're destroying me! Tearing my
mind to, to 
(Scott and Baby beam back down. Mum and Dad rush to them) 
KIRK: I'm all right. Scotty, what are you doing here? 
SCOTT: My young friend brought me. 
SPOCK: You made contact? 
SCOTT: It made contact with me. 
KIRK: What did you learn? 
SCOTT: It's only six years old but it has an IQ in the thousands. It
picked my brain, all the knowledge in the Enterprise computers, and
sent us flying off out of orbit. 
KIRK: Then how did you get here? 
SCOTT: I convinced it I wasn't a pet, and that it should bring the ship
back into orbit. Then I got it into the transporter to return here. 
SPOCK: They're trying to contact us directly. I can make out something.
It's, it's difficult, they think so fast. But the child has learned and
told its parents all about the Federation and the races it encompasses.

MCCOY: That fast? 
KIRK: What else do they know about us? 
SPOCK: We are considered simplistic, but in the process of evolving
into a higher order. 
MCCOY: Even Vulcans? 
SPOCK: Yes, even Vulcans? 
SCOTT: But the little one didn't tell or think that to me. 
KIRK: Backward child, but growing. 
SPOCK: Exactly, sir. It seems they were where we are some tens of
thousands of centuries ago. Their centuries, not ours. 
KIRK: Do we get out of here? 
SPOCK: It appears so. They do not feel we belong in their zoo. 
(A crowd has gathered to watch them leave) 
KIRK: Everyone ready to transport? 
SCOTT: So long, lad. Nice meeting you. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Prepare to beam aboard two parties, all
human.
 [Bridge]
 MARKEL: Captain, we are a scientific contact team,
and we learned practically nothing. 
KIRK: Offhand, I'd say we learned to keep our hands off. 
MARKEL: But there was so much more. 
SPOCK: There will be other opportunities, Mister Markel. I have just
received their final telepathic message. 
KIRK: Which is? 
SPOCK: We'll be welcome back, in twenty or thirty centuries. 
KIRK: Our time, or theirs. 
SPOCK: Theirs. And it will take me some time to figure out how long
that is. 
KIRK: Either way, Mister Spock, it will hardly be our problem.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - The Jihad
The
Jihad
Stardate:
5683.1
Original Airdate: 12 Jan, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 5683.1. We're making a rendezvous with the
Vedala asteroid on a unique mission. The Vedala are the oldest space
faring race we know. They say something incredibly dangerous to the
safety of our galaxy is developing and they have sent for selected
specialists, including Spock and myself.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: Maintain the Enterprise in this position,
Sulu. If Spock and I survive, we'll return here. If not, Mister Scott,
you have your orders. Energise.
 [Forest glade]
 (Five other people are already there. A tall
golden bird man, a light green insectoid, a feline, a humanoid female
and a Lizard. The forest is purple-barked trees, giant fungi and red
shrubs. The ground is blue) 
VEDALA: (feline) Welcome, Captain James Kirk and Commander Spock. I
will introduce you. First, Tchar. (Gold bird) Hereditary prince of the
Skorr, master of the eerie. Sord. (Reptile) 
EM3GREEN: (insectoid) I was sentenced to this mad expedition. My people
are cautious, what you would call cowards. 
VEDALA: As an expert lockpick and thief, you are welcome. Em3green.
Lara (the female) is a hunter. She has a flawless directional sense, a
necessary skill where you are going. Mister Spock was chosen for his
analytical mind and scientific expertise. Captain Kirk for his
leadership and adaptability. Tchar will explain your mission. 
TCHAR: Two centuries past, my people, the Skorr, were great warriors.
We had advanced military technology and we could breed vast armies
rapidly. But today we are a civilised people because of Alar. (makes a
gesture) 
KIRK: A religious leader, was he not? 
TCHAR: Our salvation and our teacher. He brought us peace. He made us
great. He died, and we made him immortal. 
VEDALA: Alar's brain patterns were recorded before his death, in a
piece of indurite sculpture. 
TCHAR: Our Soul, the Soul of the Skorr, was stolen. 
VEDALA: The theft triggered a racial fury in the Skorr. They are
preparing for war. 
KIRK: Against whom? 
TCHAR: The known galaxy. 
SPOCK: It is a very real threat. In two standard years, the existing
Skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors. 
TCHAR: My government fears this, so the theft of the Soul of Alar has
been kept secret. But we must recover it before my people discover it
gone and go mad, launch a jihad, a holy war on the galaxy. 
KIRK: Who took the Soul? 
VEDALA: Unknown. The motive, as Tchar has said, to provoke a holy war. 
SPOCK: Is there any clue to its location? 
VEDALA: A mad planet, Geologically unstable. Constant earthquakes,
gravitic shifts, tidal waves. The temperature varies from twenty Kelvin
to two hundred and four above. Somewhere on that planet, the Soul of
Alar is hidden. Three expeditions have tried to recover it. Three
expeditions have been lost. You are the next, if you agree. 
KIRK: The Vedala are a powerful race. Why haven't your people retrieved
the Soul? 
VEDALA: My people could not survive on that planet. You have a chance. 
KIRK: We agree. 
VEDALA: Then it is done. 
(She vanishes)
 [Barren planet]
 (The adventurers are gathered around an open
vehicle. The ground is flat with occasional faceted crystal rocks) 
TCHAR: I cannot feel the Soul. We are nowhere near it. 
SPOCK: That is to be expected. The surface of this planet shifts
constantly. Even the Vedala are not certain where the Soul is. 
KIRK: It has directional equipment that keys on indurite. 
SORD: I like this place, it's got variety. 
EM3GREEN: I can handle the machine. 
SPOCK: Our direction is indicated. 
EM3GREEN: It's phasing, unfocusing. 
(The directional indicator blows up) 
KIRK: Why did the Vedala call this the Mad planet? 
LARA: Means nothing. I can tell the way. That way. 
TCHAR: Are you certain, human? 
LARA: For sure, birdman. I can't get lost. I can't be fooled about
directions. That's why I'm here. 
SPOCK: The Vedala would not have chosen Lara if her abilities were less
than perfect. 
KIRK: Agreed, but we're forced to travel on the ground. I want an
overview. 
TCHAR: I will scout overhead. 
(Tchar flies off) 
SPOCK: The Vedala will have been efficient in equipping us. I will
acquaint myself with our supplies. 
LARA: Vulcans. Never liked them much myself. Cold-blooded critters, all
of them. 
KIRK: I wouldn't say that. Mister Spock is a unique personality. 
LARA: But not human like you and me. Maybe you got different customs.
My world there's a lot of females, not so many men. Come we find a man
attractive, we say so. I'm saying so. How do you find me? 
KIRK: Fascinating. But we're not here on a pleasure trip, Lara. 
LARA: All the more reason to take what pleasure there might be in it. 
SPOCK: I have checked the supplies, Captain. As expected, they are
adequate and there are weapons. 
KIRK: Against what? There's no life on this planet. 
SPOCK: But there is, Captain. Ourselves. And there may be other things
guarding the Soul of Alar.
 (They are driving through a rain storm) 
LARA: Real weather. 
KIRK: And a half. 
(Then suddenly the rain stops, the sun comes out and a volcano erupts
in the distance) 
EM3GREEN: We'll all die here. 
SPOCK: A statistical probability. 
LARA: You ever quote anything besides statistics, Vulcan? 
SPOCK: Yes. But philosophy and poetry are not appropriate here. 
TCHAR: I can see something. (lands on a cliff) I can sense it, the Soul
of Alar is there. 
(There is a golden glow from an obvious construction) 
LARA: Something's coming. 
SPOCK: A lava flow. Volcanic action is to be expected. 
LARA: Never mind that. You got to get us out of here. 
KIRK: We might be able to divert the lava flow with a barricade. Tchar,
get us a visual estimate! 
SPOCK: Such a diversion would be of short duration, Captain. And I must
point out, the vehicle lacks sufficient speed to escape. 
KIRK: Not if we used all of the power pack's energy for one high speed
run. 
SPOCK: It is possible, but the rewiring of the power leads is complex
and time-consuming. 
EM3GREEN: I could do it, if you can diagram the schematics, sir. 
SPOCK: Yes, quickly then. Terminal M3 red, lead to diode shunt A37.
Cross connect to A14. 
TCHAR: Kirk. There is a ravine sixty metres to your left. If it can be
blocked, the lava will flow past those rocks to one side. 
KIRK: Got it. Sord. 
SORD: I heard him. 
SPOCK: Carefully, Em. One missed connection could destroy us. 
EM3GREEN: I know. I'm trying to be careful. 
(Kirk, Sord and Lara push boulders off the cliff and create a rock fall
to block the ravine. 
LARA: I figure we've bought ourselves a little time. Few minutes. 
SPOCK: It's re-rigged. Hurry. 
(They rush back to the transport as the lava comes over the top of the
barrier) 
SORD: Come on, insect, move it. 
LARA: Twenty one degrees east. Fifty metres to get out of the flow
path. 
TCHAR: Hurry. 
KIRK: Go. 
(They race ahead of the red hot molten rock until they hit an
obstruction and Spock is thrown from the vehicle) 
SPOCK: Leave, all of you. 
(Kirk runs back for him) 
KIRK: Not without you. 
SPOCK: Captain, you must get the others away. 
KIRK: We're all getting away. 
(The vehicle stalls on a shale slope, and they get out and up to
safety) 
LARA: Close. 
SPOCK: Far too close, Captain. I appreciate your action on my behalf,
but your first duty is to the group and the mission. 
KIRK: Quite right, Spock. And that responsibility includes not losing
the best science officer in Starfleet. 
SORD: You two going to argue honours, or are we going to get on with
it? 
(A snowstorm starts up) 
LARA: Oh! And I was just going to ask, what next? 
KIRK: We move on. 
EM3GREEN: The power pack is burned out. 
KIRK: We'll have to carry the equipment. 
(Once again, Tchar flies off to scout ahead) 
KIRK: Anything? 
TCHAR: Wait. Yes, yes! 
(He sees the building. Then the ground opens under Em3Green and he
nearly falls into a ravine. Tchar lifts him back on land) 
EM3GREEN: I can't go any farther. I'm not even afraid anymore. Just
very tired. 
LARA: Come on, Em, a bit more. 
EM3GREEN: No. I'm finished. 
KIRK: Sorry, Em. We'll be needing you. Sord. 
EM3GREEN: Let me go. 
SORD: Hang on. (Picks him up and carries him) 
TCHAR: I'll go ahead. 
(Further on) 
KIRK: What is it? 
SORD: Not sure. Thought I saw something move in the brush. 
SPOCK: There is no life on this planet. 
SORD: Guess you're right. This planet just gets on your nerves. 
TCHAR: I can sense the Soul. I will fly ahead, examine the building,
and meet you on the way. 
KIRK: Tchar, be careful. We need you, too. 
(Tchar flies off) 
KIRK: We're tired, sore, hurt and angry, but we're also just about
there. I'll scout ahead. Everybody else stay together, keep moving. 
LARA: I'll go with you. Remember, scouting's my job. By rights, I
should be doing it alone. 
(Kirk and Lara run off) 
SPOCK: Sord, what did you think you saw back there? 
SORD: Don't know, Vulcan. A shape, couldn't really make it out.
Probably seeing things, like Kirk figures. 
SPOCK: There should be no life on this planet. 
EM3GREEN: You keep saying that. 
SPOCK: Yes. The Vedala would have informed us if there were any live
beings here we should know of. 
SORD: Maybe the Vedala didn't know about it. 
SPOCK: That is an impossibility. 
SORD: Think so? I'm not so sure.
 [Near the building]
 (There is no snow here) 
KIRK: That's it. End of a long, hard journey. 
LARA: We still have to go back, James. I tell you true, I find you an
attractive man. If we were together, the trip would be easier. And if
anything happened, why, we'd have some green memories. 
KIRK: I already have a lot of green memories. 
LARA: Oh. 
KIRK: Maybe some other time, Lara. We still have our work cut out for
us here. 
(The rest of the group have arrived) 
SPOCK: Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples? 
TCHAR: Yes. The entrance should be (he points). Can you open it? 
EM3GREEN: There is no lock I can't pick. 
(He gets to work with all six arms) 
KIRK: What is it? 
EM3GREEN: I'm opening the locks. 
LARA: Wonderful. 
EM3GREEN: No. They're on a timed trigger. If I don't get all the locks
open quickly enough, it explodes. 
(A group of purple flying dragons attack) 
SORD: Keep working. I'll cover you. 
(Kirk and Lara shoot the dragons, and they explode) 
KIRK: They're mechanical. 
SPOCK: The Vedala were right. There are no living creatures here, only
the mechanised sentinels. 
SORD: Hurry, small one. 
(Kirk stops Spock from firing at the dragon attacking Tchar) 
KIRK: We'll hit Tchar. 
LARA: What happened to Tchar? 
KIRK: There's no way to tell from here. The mechanical exploded. We
can't reach the roof from the outside. We'll have to try to get to him
from the interior. 
EM3GREEN: Done. 
(The doors open) 
KIRK: We could rest awhile. Lara? 
LARA: No. We've come this far. 
SORD: Let's finish it. Or give this deadfall a chance to finish us. 
SPOCK: I too would prefer to press on, Captain. The mechanicals on
guard may be what Sord saw tracking us earlier. Or there may be others.
In either case, it would be more advantageous to avoid another
encounter.
 [Temple]
 (An object is hanging in mid-air, glowing) 
SORD: Pretty. How do we reach it? 
SPOCK: The walls are not climbable. 
KIRK: Not without special equipment, which we don't have. Either we
find a way to reach it from here, or we fail. 
(The door closes behind them) 
EM3GREEN: No lock on the inside. We are prisoners. 
KIRK: That's right. 
LARA: You're not exactly surprised. 
KIRK: Three previous expeditions tried and were lost. The planet is a
natural trap, but that's not enough. 
SPOCK: You suggest sabotage, Captain? 
KIRK: Yes, from inside each expedition. Remember Spock, you were the
one who said there are no life forms here except ourselves. 
EM3GREEN: One of us? 
KIRK: It's likely. 
SPOCK: Approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the
possibility. 
KIRK: But it doesn't matter if we reach the Soul. Apparently the others
didn't get this far. 
(He spots a ledge around the inside of the building, and jumps up to
it. The others join him, except) 
SORD: I'm not built for that sort of thing. I'll wait for you down
here. 
(As they inch along the foot-deep ledge, there is a quake) 
SPOCK: The planet is geologically unstable. This structure is
inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes. 
EM3GREEN: It can, but what about us? 
KIRK: Look. 
EM3GREEN: We can almost reach it. 
LARA: Maybe I can get a line on it. 
SPOCK: It is locked in a force field. Your rope would merely bounce off
it. 
KIRK: Spock, will our combined phasers disrupt the field? 
SPOCK: I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but 
(An energy weapon blasts a hole in the wall near them) 
KIRK: The last piece of sabotage. I know who you are. A thousand feet
up, no method of reaching the Soul, except by air, by flight. Tchar. 
(The golden birdman comes down and hovers) 
LARA: Tchar. In the name of the Seven Gods, why? 
KIRK: You stole this. You'll start a bloody crusade across the galaxy.
Tell us why, Tchar. 
TCHAR: The Skorr were a warrior race. Now what are we? Slaves to the
illusion of peace. Cowards, soft in our comfort. This sick dream has
stolen our souls. I am Tchar, hereditary prince of the Skorr, leader of
battles. I will lead my people into glory, to avenge our history. 
SPOCK: Most of them will be killed. The warrior races of the Federation
will rise up to battle the Skorr. 
TCHAR: Yes. A noble death to win a great dream. We will live no longer
like worms crawling in the dirt. We will conquer. You will die. But you
have my respect. You fought well. You die in grace. 
(They all start to float upwards) 
EM3GREEN: He's turned on a gravity neutraliser in the building. 
TCHAR: Now you can fly and fight as a Skorr. 
SORD: No offence, little ones, but let me tackle him. 
KIRK: Not in free fall. 
EM3GREEN: Use your phaser on him. 
KIRK: Too risky. He controls the fortress phaser bank, and they're set
on kill. No, it has to be on his terms. Spock, how long since you've
worked out in null-gravity combat exercises? 
SPOCK: Last week with you, Captain. 
KIRK: Let's go. 
(They push off from the walls and manage to grab Tchar by his wings.
Then Kirk hooks his into the Soul) 
KIRK: Call for retrieval, now. 
(Lara presses a button) 
TCHAR: Let me die. 
KIRK: You're going back with us. 
(They all vanish in a golden haze)
 [Forest glade]
 (The Soul is in the middle of the group. Tchar is
in a transparent box) 
VEDALA: We give you thanks. The Soul of Alar is returned to his people.

KIRK: What about Tchar? How are you going to punish him? 
VEDALA: He will be healed of his madness. He is proud, brave. That he
will remain, but he will also be sane and whole again. (Tchar vanishes)
We cannot reward you. For the good of the Skorr, this must be forever
secret. You have only our thanks. 
SORD: Got nowhere to keep a medal, anyway. But there'll be questions. 
VEDALA: No. You will return and you will see, there will be no
questions, no medals, only our thanks. And in time, even the memory
will be gone from you. 
LARA: Goodbye, James Kirk. Too bad.
 [Transporter room]
 SULU: Captain. Mister Spock, what happened? 
KIRK: What do you mean? 
SULU: You transported over and came right back. Did they call it off? 
SPOCK: How long were we gone? 
SULU: Long? About two minutes, I guess. I don't understand. 
KIRK: The Vedala changed their minds. The danger is past. Back to your
stations. We have a lot of other places to go.

The
Pirates of Orion
Stardate:
6334.1
Original Airdate: 7 Sep, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 6334.1. The outbreak of choriocytosis aboard
the Enterprise seems to be under control. Doctor McCoy says the disease
is no longer even as serious as pneumonia, and there should be no
problem completing our present mission, representing the Federation at
the dedication ceremonies for the new Academy of Science on Deneb Five.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Status, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: All systems affirmative, Captain. The Enterprise is on course
and on schedule. 
KIRK: It'll be nice to play diplomat for a change, eh, Spock? 
(Spock grimaces in pain and falls to the floor, unconscious. 
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency!
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: Jim, choriocytosis is a strange disease. In
races with iron-based blood, it's practically nothing, but in others 
KIRK: Get to the point, Bones. 
MCCOY: Spock has contracted the disease. It's fatal to Vulcans. 
KIRK: Are you sure? 
MCCOY: I've triple-checked, Jim. I wish to God I was wrong. Spock's
blood is copper-based. The infection enters the blood stream, and
encases the cells so they can't carry oxygen. 
KIRK: The result is suffocation. 
MCCOY: Yes, Jim. 
KIRK: Is there any cure? 
MCCOY: One. A naturally occurring drug called strobolin. But it's only
found on a few planets in the galaxy. 
KIRK: Library computer. 
COMPUTER: Working. 
KIRK: What is the nearest strobolin supply planet to our present
position? 
COMPUTER: Beta Canopus. Four solar days away at maximum warp. 
KIRK: How long can Spock last without the drug? 
MCCOY: I can give him injections of a synthesised drug that would slow
the disease. But after two days the body builds up an immunity. It
loses its effectiveness. By the end of the third day, the disease will
be irreversible. 
KIRK: It'll take four days to get the drug, but Spock will die in
three. There's got to be a way. 
MCCOY: What about a rendezvous? 
KIRK: Of course. If we cant go out of our way to get the drug in time,
there must be another ship closer to Beta Canopus. Kirk to Bridge. Get
me Starfleet, Lieutenant.
 Captain's log, supplemental. We've arranged to get
the strobolin needed to save Mister Spock's life. The starship Potemkin
has already picked up the drug and will transfer it to a freighter, the
SS Huron, for delivery to the Enterprise.
 [Briefing room]
 KIRK: What will the symptoms be, Bones? 
MCCOY: Increasing tiredness, steadily decreasing efficiency, all the
symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Kind of like the
test you had to pass back at the Academy. 
(A knock at the door) 
KIRK: Come. 
SPOCK: You wished to see me, sir? 
KIRK: Yes, Spock. Sit down. We've arranged a rendezvous to pick up the
drug you need. 
SPOCK: I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb Five. 
KIRK: No, it won't. 
SPOCK: Will that be all, Captain? 
KIRK: One other thing. I've cut your duty time in half. 
SPOCK: Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able 
MCCOY: No arguments, Spock. Doctor's orders. 
SPOCK: Anything else, sir? 
KIRK: That's all, Spock. Dismissed. 
(Spock leaves) 
KIRK: It'll hurt seeing him like that. 
MCCOY: I know. As much as it might seem at times that I can't stand
that pointy-eared encyclopaedia, I don't want to see that happen to
him.
 [Huron Bridge]
 (The crew are in starfleet uniforms) 
NUMBER ONE: (its a woman) ETA at rendezvous point, two hours and seven
minutes, Captain. 
O'SHEA: Good. That's a pretty important drug we've got for the
Enterprise. I'd just as soon get rid of it and get back to shipping
just dilithium. 
HELMSMAN: Sir, our sensors are picking up a ship ahead. 
O'SHEA: Could the Enterprise be that early? 
HELMSMAN: I'm not sure it's the Enterprise, sir. It's too far away to
tell. 
O'SHEA: Where's it headed? 
HELMSMAN: Toward us, sir. 
O'SHEA: Keep an eye on it, Lieutenant.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Time to rendezvous, Mister Arex? 
AREX: One hour forty three minutes, sir. 
KIRK: I hate to ask, but 
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. We'll squeeze a wee bit more speed out of her. 
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy to Bridge. 
KIRK: What is it, Bones? 
MCCOY [OC]: Tell Spock it's time for another shot. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. Spock. 
SPOCK: I was conserving energy, Captain. 
KIRK: McCoy wants you in Sickbay.
 [Huron Bridge]
 HELMSMAN: Sensor readout, Captain. It's not the
Enterprise closing on us, sir. 
O'SHEA: Another starship? 
HELMSMAN: No, sir. It's an alien ship, a design I've never seen before.

O'SHEA: Put it on the screen. 
(A wicked-looking bat-like design in red appears) 
O'SHEA: You're sure it's following us? 
NUMBER ONE: It's on an intercept course now, Captain. And at this
speed, they'll get us before we get to the Enterprise.
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: This won't hurt a bit, Spock. 
SPOCK: An unnecessary assurance, Doctor, in addition to being untrue. 
MCCOY: That's the last time I waste my bedside manner on a Vulcan. 
SPOCK: Such restraint would be welcome. 
MCCOY: Not so fast, Spock. Lie there quietly. 
(The monitor buzzes then goes quiet) 
MCCOY: Well, that's not too bad. Back to work, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. 
(Spock leaves) 
CHAPEL: The drug isn't working any more. 
MCCOY: I know, Christine. I know. Don't worry, we'll have the strobolin
soon.
 [Huron Bridge]
 HELMSMAN: They've increased speed, sir, closing
fast. 
O'SHEA: Open hailing frequencies again. 
NUMBER ONE: Open, sir. 
O'SHEA: To unidentified alien vessel. This is Captain O'Shea of the SS
Huron. Please state your registry and purpose. Repeat. Please identify
yourself and your purpose. 
NUMBER ONE: It's no use, sir. They're receiving but they're not
answering. 
O'SHEA: Well, we've got a hold full of dilithium and that drug to
protect. Evasive manoeuvres. 
(But the alien stays with them) 
HELMSMAN: No good, Captain. Send out an emergency signal to the
Enterprise. 
NUMBER ONE: Yes, sir. Message from the alien, sir. 
O'SHEA: Let's hear it. 
ORION [OC]: Prepare to surrender your cargo or be destroyed.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Captain, I'm getting a signal from the
Huron. It's an emergency beacon, automated. 
KIRK: Try ship to ship. 
UHURA: I did, sir. No response. 
KIRK: Sensor report, Mister Spock. Are they at the rendezvous point? 
SPOCK: No, sir. They hadn't reached it. 
KIRK: Compute new course, Mister Arex. Let's see what's going on. 
(They arrive at the Huron) 
SPOCK: The Huron's power levels are at bare minimum for life support,
Captain. I'm picking up metallic debris. 
KIRK: Was the Huron attacked? 
SPOCK: Based on present data, I would say yes. 
KIRK: Spock, are you all right? 
SPOCK: Captain, I (collapses) 
UHURA: Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency.
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: We've got to have that drug, Jim. The
synthetic is useless now. 
KIRK: Do what you can, Bones. 
MCCOY: Blasted Vulcan. Why couldn't you have red blood like any normal
human?
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Status? 
AREX: (at Spock's station) The Huron's engines are dead. Emergency
battery power is operating life support systems at a low but acceptable
level. 
UHURA: Still unable to make contact, sir. 
KIRK: Is anyone on that ship alive? 
AREX: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Mister Scott, Lieutenant Uhura, come with me. Mister Sulu, you
have the conn. We're beaming over.
 [Huron Bridge]
 (The officers are slumped over their consoles) 
KIRK: Scotty, check the cargo hold. See if the drug is there. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir. (leaves) 
KIRK: Uhura, see if you can get a playback of the log. I want to know
what happened here. Nurse, attend to the wounded.
 [Huron Cargo hold]
 (It's many stories high - and empty) 
SCOTT: Scott to Captain Kirk.
 [Huron Bridge]
 KIRK: Kirk here. Report, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT [OC]: There's nothing down here, Captain. 
KIRK: No drug?
 [Huron Cargo hold]
 SCOTT: No drug and no dilithium shipment. The hold
is completely empty.
 [Huron Bridge]
 KIRK: All right. Report back up here. 
UHURA: This screen is out, sir. But we can take the tapes and play them
back on the Enterprise. 
KIRK: Good. Nurse, how is he? 
CHAPEL: He needs surgery, Captain, but he'll live. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Ready to beam over. Have the medical team
standing by.
 [Sickbay]
 (The beds are full now) 
KIRK: How's O'Shea, Bones? 
MCCOY: He'll pull through. Jim, what about Spock? If we don't have that
drug in twenty hours, he'll die.
 Captain's log, stardate 6335.6. The Huron has been
left as space junk, its engines sabotaged. Captain O'Shea has no idea
who attacked his ship, but the intruder must be found and the precious
cargo retrieved.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: I've run the Huron's sensor tapes through
the computer, sir. The intruder ship is a new design, never before
encountered by Federation shipping. 
KIRK: Can we track it? 
AREX: Yes, sir. The intruder ship produces a unique trail of
radioactive waste, now bearing two one two degrees mark one seven five.

KIRK: Lay in that course, Sulu. Ahead warp factor seven.
 [McCoy's office]
 KIRK: How is he, Bones? 
MCCOY: Not good, Jim. I'll have to put a respirator on him to help him
breathe soon. 
KIRK: We're following the intruder ship's trail. 
MCCOY: We don't even know it it's the right one. 
KIRK: It's got to be. 
MCCOY: What's the use of being a doctor, anyway? We're only as good as
our drugs and technology make us. Underneath all the tricks, I might as
well be practising in the Middle Ages. 
KIRK: If you really believed that, Bones, you wouldn't still be a
doctor after twenty five years.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Report. 
SULU: Radioactive residue still bearing two one two degrees mark one
seven five. 
KIRK: Increase speed to warp eight. 
SULU: The trail goes through the asteroid belt, Captain. 
KIRK: A good place for an intruder to hide, wouldn't you say, Mister
Sulu? 
SULU: Perfect. And a long range sensor can show that the radioactive
residue stops in the middle of the belt. 
KIRK: Deflectors up. Yellow Alert. Cut speed to warp one. 
(There's an explosion outside) 
KIRK: What was that? 
AREX: These asteroids are composed of a highly unstable mineral
combination, sir. They explode upon impact with each other. 
KIRK: Or anything else. Keep those deflectors up, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Captain, if the power of those rocks could be harnessed, they'd
make a fantastic source of energy. 
KIRK: Also make quite a weapon. Steady as she goes, Sulu. 
(Sailing through the asteroids, a beam hits the shields) 
SCOTT: Deflectors holding, sir. 
KIRK: Hard to port, Sulu. Let's face them head on. 
(The red bat-ship comes on the viewscreen) 
KIRK: Hold position. Analysis, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: Standard phasers, sir. Weak, though. A diffused, low quality
beam. Our deflectors can stop them. 
AREX: I recognise the ship's markings, Captain. It's an Orion. 
KIRK: Orion. 
UHURA: They're hailing us, Captain. 
KIRK: Put it on visual, Lieutenant. 
(These Orions are blue-skinned, wearing green suits and half-helmets) 
ORION [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, we demand that you cease your
pursuit immediately. I must protest, as a representative of a neutral
planet. 
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. For a neutral, you were pretty quick to
fire your phasers. 
ORION [on viewscreen]: We couldn't be sure you were non-hostile. 
KIRK: Orion's neutrality has been in dispute ever since the affair
regarding the Coridan planets and the Babel Conference of stardate
3850.3. Yesterday, a Federation freighter was attacked in this
quadrant, its cargo hijacked. As the first alien ship encountered, we
require you to submit to search, as per Babel Resolution A12. Reply. 
ORION [on viewscreen]: We have no Federation cargo aboard. Orions are
not thieves. If you don't cease this harassment, we will lodge a formal
protest with your government. 
KIRK: Hold on that, Uhura. Tell them to stand by. 
SULU: Sensors picking up the dilithium in their hold, sir. 
KIRK: What about the drug? 
SULU: If they have it, it's too small an amount to detect. 
KIRK: Uhura, open the channel. 
UHURA: Channel open, sir. 
KIRK: Enterprise to Orion vessel. I have a proposal to make. If you do
have the Huron's cargo, there were some perishable drugs in it that we
desperately need.
 [Orion Bridge]
 ORION: What would these drugs be worth to you if
we had them? 
KIRK [on viewscreen]: You keep the dilithium shipment, no mention of
the whole incident to Starfleet or in my log, plus and additional
galactic standard weight container of dilithium as payment for the
drug. 
ORION: We get what we want, plus our neutrality remains intact? We will
consider your offer. 
KIRK [on viewscreen]: Very well. Kirk out.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay. 
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. 
KIRK: Bones, how much time? 
MCCOY [OC]: Less than an hour, Jim. His body functions are slipping
fast now. 
KIRK: Just hold out a little longer. 
UHURA: The Orions are hailing us, sir. 
KIRK: Put it on the screen, Lieutenant. 
ORION [on viewscreen]: Your proposal requires us to trust you. It's
obvious we can't. 
KIRK: Do you have a counterproposal? 
ORION [on viewscreen]: Yes. A face to face exchange between you and me.

KIRK: Face to face? Where?
 [Orion Bridge]
 ORION: On the large asteroid near our ships. We
could beam down simultaneously, and I would hand you the drug myself.
You wouldn't even have to give us the extra dilithium crystals. Now
it's your turn to consider.
 [Briefing room]
 MCCOY: It's got to be a trap, Jim. 
SCOTT: No doubt of it, sir. 
KIRK: It could be a trap, but it's the only way to get the drug. And
Spock will die if we don't. 
MCCOY: You've already made up your mind, haven't you, Jim. 
KIRK: Yes, but not without precautions. I'll keep my communicator
channel open so you can hear what goes on. Keep the transporter locked
on me, and if anything goes wrong, Scotty, I'm trusting you. 
MCCOY: If this doesn't work, we could lose you and Spock. 
KIRK: If we don't try, Spock doesn't have a chance.
 [Orion Bridge]
 ORION: Status, Lieutenant? 
LIEUTENANT: We can't outshoot the Enterprise and we can't outrun it,
sir. 
ORION: You're saying we can't escape? 
LIEUTENANT: No, sir, we can't. 
ORION: Orion's official neutrality comes before this ship or its crew.
We can't take Kirk's word that he won't report this incident to
Starfleet. 
LIEUTENANT: The only way to do that is to destroy the Enterprise, and
the only way to do that is to destroy ourselves, too. 
ORION: Do you have a plan, Lieutenant? 
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir. These asteroids are made of highly explosive
minerals. 
ORION: Can we convert the asteroid we're orbiting into a doomsday bomb
that will destroy both ships? 
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir, but 
ORION: But what? 
LIEUTENANT: Analysis of the asteroid shows that it can't be detonated
by our phasers. 
ORION: What will it take? 
LIEUTENANT: A powerful explosive right on the asteroid's surface. I
could rig a remote control device. 
ORION: No. I'll take it with me when I beam down to meet Captain Kirk.
I want the satisfaction of seeing his face when I tell him he and his
crew are going to die with us. And I'm sure they don't trust us. If
Kirk and I are on the asteroid, the Enterprise will stay close by. 
LIEUTENANT: Very well, sir. I'll get to work.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Enterprise to Orion vessel. 
ORION [OC]: What is your answer, Captain? 
KIRK: I accept your terms. 
ORION [OC]: Very well. We will synchronise co-ordinates and beam down
in fifteen minutes. 
MCCOY: Jim, we don't have a lot of time. Spock 
ORION [on viewscreen]: Fifteen minutes or not at all, Captain. 
KIRK: All right. Kirk out.
 [Asteroid surface]
 (The two Captains beam down with full life support
fields on) 
ORION: The drug, as promised, Captain. Scan it if you wish.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK [OC]: Pure strobolin. I'll take that now and
we can both beam up.
 [Asteroid surface]
 ORION: No, Captain. I can't trust that you won't
report this incident to Starfleet. If you do, my planet will lose its
neutrality and be subject to Federation retaliation. 
KIRK: You can't escape the Enterprise. 
ORION: But we can destroy it.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: Picking up unusual sensor readings, Mister
Scott. 
SCOTT: What is it? 
AREX: There's dilithium down there with them, sir.
 [Asteroid surface]
 ORION: I have an explosive device in my backpack
that will start a molecular chain reaction and detonate this asteroid.
Your ship will be destroyed. 
KIRK: But so will yours. 
ORION: All unsuccessful Orion missions end in suicide. 
(Kirk grapples with him, to stop him pressing the button on his belt)
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: The dilithium. Transporter room, pinpoint
those crystals down there and beam them up!
 [Transporter room]
 CHIEF: Pinpointed, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT [OC]: Beam them up now, lad.
 [Asteroid surface]
 (The Orion finally breaks free of Kirk and presses
the button. Nothing happens) 
KIRK: Scotty, energise. 
(Kirk grabs the Orion again and they are beamed up)
 [Transporter room]
 (Scott and two security guards are there) 
SCOTT: Captain, it was close. 
KIRK: Let's get up to the Bridge.
 [Orion Bridge]
 ENSIGN: They're gone, sir. 
LIEUTENANT: Gone? 
ENSIGN: I was scanning as you ordered, and they just disappeared off
the asteroid. Both the Earther and the Captain. 
LIEUTENANT: He's been captured, no doubt. Arm our self-destruct system,
Ensign.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Open hailing frequencies, Uhura. 
(The Orion goes to put a capsule in his mouth) 
KIRK: Grab him! Poison. I'm sure your ship is ready to self-destruct,
Captain, but if it does, your crew will die for nothing. We're not
going to let you commit suicide. Whether they die or not, you'll still
stand trial, and Orion's little game of neutrality and piracy is over. 
UHURA: I have the Orion vessel, sir. 
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. We have your captain as prisoner. Your
choice, sir. 
ORION: Disarm the self-destruct system. Prepare to surrender to the
Enterprise.
 Captain's log, stardate 6336.2. The Orion crew is
in our brig, their ship in tow, and the Enterprise is back on course
for Deneb Five.
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: Spock, there's no way you can deny it. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, I 
MCCOY: I've waited a long time for this, and you're not going to cheat
me. 
KIRK: Am I interrupting something? 
SPOCK: Nothing but Doctor McCoy's gloating. 
MCCOY: Spock, that green blood of yours may have saved you before, but
this time it almost did you in. You can't deny it. 
SPOCK: I still prefer my physiological structure to yours. 
KIRK: Yes, gentlemen, things are back to normal. 
MCCOY: He's as stubborn as ever. (laughs)

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - Bem
Bem
Stardate: 7403.6 
Original Airdate: Sep 14, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 7403.6. The Enterprise is on a series of
exploratory and contact missions. Travelling with us as an independent
observer is a member of a recently contacted alien species, Honorary
Commander Ari bn Bem. He's from the planet Pandro in the Garo Seven
system. We have taken up orbit around Delta Theta Three, a newly
discovered class M planet. A previous scouting mission has reported
possible aboriginal life forms here, and the Enterprise is to
investigate and report.
 [Briefing room]
 (Enterprise is orbiting a very green planet) 
KIRK: Sensors report several groupings of aborigines. They may be
dangerous. So I want all of us to avoid any unnecessary risks. But
these monitoring devices have to be planted. Lieutenant Uhura will be
tracking us throughout. Now, if there's any trouble of any kind, beam
up immediately. Don't try to be a hero. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 (Bem is a green upright biped in a jumpsuit, with
a red crest and slit irises to his eyes. Not quite the Bug Eyed Monster
his name implies!) 
BEM: Kirk Captain, settings are almost complete. 
KIRK: Commander Bem, what are you doing here? 
BEM: This one has decided to accompany contact team for observation of
same. 
KIRK: Commander Bem, you were assigned to this ship as an independent
observer, yet you have spent the past six missions in your quarters.
You haven't done any observing at all until now, when we're dealing
with possibly a very dangerous planet. 
BEM: Patience. Every planet is dangerous to the ignorant. This one has
decided that the nexus is now. Must observe workings of starship and
crew. 
KIRK: This mission is not for casual observers. It could be hazardous. 
BEM: Am prepared. 
KIRK: Commander Bem, this is not a joyride, a pleasure excursion. I
cannot let you beam down to the planet without adequate protection. I'm
sure you understand the diplomatic consequences if anything were to
happen to you while you are under my protection. 
BEM: Understanding it is, Captain, but this one remains adamant. Am
prepared to accompany. 
KIRK: This is an odd time to remain adamant. All right, let's go.
There's a planet waiting for us. 
BEM: This one has already set controls, Mister Scotty. 
SCOTT: Everything appears to be all right, sir. Co-ordinates are locked
on the landing site. 
KIRK: Energise.
 [Planet surface]
 (Three of the party materialise at the edge of a
lake, but Kirk and Spock materialise over the water and fall in. Bem
jumps in after them) 
BEM: Assistance is offered. 
(Underwater, Bem's lower half walks around the back of Kirk and Spock,
and two sinuous arms take their phasers and communicators, replacing
them with fakes?) 
KIRK: We're all right. 
(Back on dry land) 
KIRK: In the future, Commander Bem, you will leave the operation of the
transporter to Mister Scott, or one of the regular transporter crew. 
SCOTT: Captain, Lieutenant Uhura reports some peculiar activity here on
the planet. 
KIRK: (taking Scott's communicator) What is it, Lieutenant?
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Lieutenant Arex has been tracking a
non-network sensory stasis. It's hardly more than a flicker, and it's
several thousand kilometres west of your position. 
KIRK [OC]: Say again. 
UHURA: An anomaly, sir. It resembles a sensor field, but without a
scanning grid or other point of reference. 
KIRK [OC]: Is it moving? 
AREX: Brownian movement only, Captain. No discernible direction.
 [Planet surface]
 SPOCK: The implication is that there is something
else on this planet. Perhaps something intelligent. 
KIRK: It might be just an atmospheric effect. Some kind of electrical
storm. We've seen unidentified planetary phenomena before that have
resembled intelligent activity.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK [OC]: Keep watching it, Lieutenant Uhura, and
put the ship on Yellow Alert. We'll continue the contact mission for
now, but notify us immediately if there's any change in the situation.
Kirk out.
 [Planet surface]
 (The landing party is walking along) 
SPOCK: The rain forest is especially thick in his district. Life on
this planet appears to be geologically younger than one would expect,
given the age of this star. 
(Something is watching them) 
BEM: This one is picking up readings of a large group of life forms
directly ahead. 
KIRK: All right. We must take care not to be seen. Hey, Bem. Bem, come
back! Scotty, Sulu, stay here with the monitoring devices. Come on,
Spock. 
(They give chase) 
SPOCK: He won't get far in there. 
KIRK: Let's go. 
(But Bem divides into several smaller pieces and floats through the
tangle of stems and trunks with ease before rejoining into one) 
KIRK: He's gone. 
SPOCK: He would have had to go through here to escape. 
KIRK: There he is. I don't know how he did it, but he got through. Come
on, we'll have to go around. That Pandronian's actions just don't make
sense. 
SPOCK: They might to another Pandronian, Captain. I believe he went
that way, Captain. On the other hand 
KIRK: I think we've lost him. That way. 
(Bem is surrounded by Lizard people with spears) 
SPOCK: It appears to be a native food-gathering party. 
KIRK: Yes, and the food they have gathered is Bem.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: Lieutenant Uhura, I'm reading increased
activity on the surface of the planet. The sensory anomaly appears to
be expanding. 
UHURA: Contact the landing party.
 [Planet surface]
 SCOTT: Commander Scott here. 
UHURA [OC]: Mister Scott, where's the Captain?
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT [OC]: He's been separated from us. Commander
Bem ran off for some reason. They're in the forest. 
UHURA: The Captain is not answering his communicator and it does not
show up on the scanning grid. It's as if its responder has been
disconnected. We're picking up increased activity from that anomaly. Is
Mister Spock with the Captain?
 [Planet surface]
 SCOTT: Aye. They both went after Commander Bem.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Lieutenant Arex, start a sensor scan for
Captain Kirk and Mister Spock. Landing party, prepare to beam up. 
SCOTT [OC]: Lieutenant Uhura, we could track the Captain down. 
UHURA: I'm sorry, Mister Scott, that's not procedure. We can't take
chances.
 [Planet surface]
 SCOTT: We're talking about the Captain.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: I know it, but we have to follow his
orders. Stand by to beam up. 
SCOTT: Standing by.
 [Planet surface]
 (Kirk and Spock are still hiding in foliage) 
KIRK: Maybe we can beam him out of there. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to
Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. This isn't my communicator. 
SPOCK: These are not Enterprise communicators, Captain. They are fakes.
Excellent, but non-working forgeries. 
KIRK: This communicator's been on my belt since we beamed down. 
SPOCK: Our phasers don't work either. 
KIRK: Our phasers and communicators have been switched for phonies and
Commander Bem has run off. We've been separated from the rest of the
landing party. Mister Spock, something funny is going on. 
SPOCK: An alternate course of action would appear to be advisable. 
KIRK: But Commander Bem's difficulty appears to be genuine. Phasers or
not, we have to rescue him. We're going to have to follow them. 
(Bem is being marched away by the lizard people) 
SPOCK: One of us could go back to contact Mister Scott. 
KIRK: We can't risk it, not while they're moving. We may never be able
to find them again. 
(Later, they are lying on a hill overlooking a wicker and thatched hut
village) 
SPOCK: These aborigines appear to be in a late primitive state.
Obviously intelligent, they seem to have a basic language and social
structure. I would assume fairly well developed mores and traditions as
well. 
KIRK: Commander Bem seems to be a model prisoner. 
(Bem is in a small wooden cage, just big enough to stand up and turn
around in) 
KIRK: We'll have to wait until nightfall.
 [Village - night]
 BEM: Kirk Captain? 
KIRK: Shut up. We're rescuing you. 
BEM: You are interfering with observations. 
SPOCK: This is how you observe, by being captured? 
BEM: As logical a way as any, Spock Commander. 
KIRK: (opening the door) I don't think Starfleet would approve. Come
on. 
(But the lizard people have caught them) 
KIRK: Uh oh.
 [Village - day]
 (Kirk and Spock have their own personal cages) 
KIRK: How come we always end up like this? 
SPOCK: I assume that's a rhetorical question, Captain, not requiring an
answer. 
KIRK: I was just expressing my curiosity at our ability to get into
these kind of situations. 
SPOCK: Fate, Captain. Fate. 
KIRK: Fate, Spock? 
SPOCK: I believe that is the correct Earth term. 
KIRK: Why don't you try your Vulcan nerve pinch. 
SPOCK: Captain, I am only a Vulcan. There are limits. 
KIRK: Commander Bem, I'm afraid that we're not going to be able to
rescue you. 
BEM: Good intentions, Kirk Captain, are not enough. Planet Pandro will
be much displeased. Starfleet told us you are best captain in fleet.
Actions to date belie this. 
KIRK: Commander Bem, you are responsible for the situation we are in.
You disobeyed orders by running off. Your attitude has been extremely
abrasive and, I don't know how you did it. You replaced our phasers and
communicators with phonies. 
BEM: You place too much dependence, Kirk Captain, on phasers and
communicators. 
KIRK: Either one could solve our problems right now. 
BEM: If that is all. (taking the items out of his pockets) 
KIRK: Commander Bem, if you had those two phasers and those
communicators all this time, why didn't you use them to escape? 
BEM: Sir, this one does not demean oneself by the use of casual
violence to accomplish goals. But you may demean yourself if you wish. 
KIRK: I want those phasers and communicators now. 
BEM: Compliance with orders is. This one must disassemble. 
(and while his top half hangs in mid air, Bem's lower half runs over to
Kirk and small arms hand over the phasers and communicators) 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
(Spock is given his equipment) 
SPOCK: Remarkable. Commander Bem is a colony creature. 
KIRK: Commander Bem, if you could split yourself into separate parts,
why didn't you escape on your own earlier? 
BEM: And deny you the opportunity to prove your value to planet Pandro
by rescuing this one from possibly dangerous situation? 
KIRK: This is not a laboratory, Commander Bem. This is a hostile
planet, and representatives of Starfleet are not experimental animals
for you to test! Consider yourself under arrest. Protective custody, to
keep you from any more escapades. Mister Spock, keep watch.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: Lieutenant Arex, have you found them yet? 
AREX: No, sir. It is a big planet. 
UHURA: Mister Scott, that sensory anomaly, it's expanded to cover the
whole northern continent. 
SCOTT: What's that? 
UHURA: We can't get any readings at all now. 
SCOTT: Aye, that tears it. The Loch Ness monster couldn't get through
that.
 [Village]
 {Kirk, Spock and Bem are hiding behind a hut) 
KIRK: There's some kind of interference on all channels. We're going to
have to get out of this village on our own. 
SPOCK: I doubt we'll be able to do so without being seen, Captain. 
KIRK: I concur, Mister Spock. Set phasers to stun, just in case. 
(They are spotted) 
KIRK: Fire. 
(But a dark red glow envelopes them) 
ENTITY: No, do not use your weapons. 
KIRK: I'm paralysed. 
SPOCK: We're held in stasis, Captain. 
ENTITY: Put away your weapons. These are my children. Do not harm them.

KIRK: Who are you? 
ENTITY: Who are you? 
KIRK: I am Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This
is my first officer, Mister Spock and honorary Commander Ari bn Bem of
the planet Pandro. 
ENTITY: Why are you here? Why do you disturb this place? 
KIRK: It is our mission. We must classify this planet. We have to test
it. 
ENTITY: Classify? What gives you the right to intrude here? This planet
is not for your use. My children are not for your tests. Your weapons
will be nullified. 
(The phasers disappear and the glow stops) 
KIRK: There are times, Mister Spock, when I think I should have been a
librarian. 
SPOCK: The job of librarian would be no less challenging, Captain, but
it would undoubtedly be a lot less dangerous.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: Have you found the Captain yet? 
AREX: I have located emanations that could be Captain Kirk's and
another set that could be Mister Spock's, but the sensory anomaly has
interfered with our detection devices so that positive identification
remains impossible. 
UHURA: Which means? 
SCOTT: I think he said 'maybe'. Well, that convinces me. Ready a
security squad. We're going down there. Issue phaser rifles.
 [Village]
 (Kirk, Spock and Bem are back in their cages) 
BEM: You have mishandled situation again, Kirk Captain. This one judges
you not an intelligent commander. 
KIRK: Commander Bem, Mister Spock and I are here because we thought
that you were worth rescuing. It was more to preserve the diplomatic
relations between the Federation and planet Pandro than from any great
affection for yourself. 
BEM: Planet Pandro is unconcerned as to fate of this one. Pandro will
not have dealings with inefficient and inferior species. You have
failed everything you have attempted. You have not rescued this one and
you have not been able to handle local aborigines. 
(Bem splits himself up and walks over to Kirk's cage) 
BEM: This one wishes you, what is the Earth word? Luck. You will
require it. 
(And he or they walk away) 
KIRK: Wait! Unlock us. Set us free! 
SPOCK: Captain, perhaps we can attract the attention of the alien
intelligence and reason with it. 
KIRK: It's worth a try. (into communicator) Kirk to alien intelligence.
This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling intelligence of
this planet. Answer me, please. 
SPOCK: Perhaps an offering of some sort, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, whatever we're dealing with, I don't think we can
bribe it. We must be honest. Kirk to alien intelligence. I don't think
it's strong enough to be noticeable. 
SPOCK: Hmm. If we connect our two communicators in series, we can give
off a high energy burst which might work, but it will also render the
communicators powerless in a very short time. 
KIRK: Do it. 
(Kirk throws his communicator to Spock, and gets it back with the other
stuck to it, very quickly) 
KIRK: This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling
intelligence of this planet. Do you hear me? Kirk to entity. Kirk to
entity. 
ENTITY: I am here. 
KIRK: We apologise for intruding. We did not realise the situation. We
will leave. We will tell others of our kind not to bother you here. 
ENTITY: This is good. Go. Go now and do not return. 
KIRK: Just one thing. There is a third member of our group. 
ENTITY: I detect no third intelligence. 
KIRK: He has fled. 
ENTITY: You must go. You must not interfere with my children. I will
allow you to contact your ship. Go now! 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. 
UHURA [OC]: Enterprise. Uhura here. Captain, are you all right? 
KIRK: Stand by. We're not leaving without Bem. He is our
responsibility. We can't leave him here. Beam down a security squad
with heavy duty tricorders set for Pandronian scanning. 
UHURA [OC]: Aye, aye, Captain. 
(Four figures materialise) 
SCOTT: Captain, are you all right? 
(Scott phasers the cage open) 
KIRK: Thanks, Scotty. Spread out. Find Commander Bem. He's split into
three individual parts. 
SCOTT: Beg pardon, sir? 
KIRK: He's some kind of colony creature. And take care not to injure
any of the natives here. Phasers on lightest possible stun setting. And
don't fire unless absolutely necessary. 
(No sooner do they spread out to search, than the Lizard people attack.
They have captured Bem. The Starfleet people use their phasers and the
Lizard people drop their spears and flee) 
KIRK: Let's get out of here before we make any more trouble. 
BEM: Embarrassment results. This one is shamed. This one has failed in
its judgement. 
KIRK: You have endangered all of us by your actions, and you have
forced us to interfere with the natives of a planet that deserves prime
directive protection. 
BEM: This one exists by its own standards. 
KIRK: Not on my ship you don't. 
ENTITY: You are still here? You are still interfering? I am angered. 
KIRK: We could not leave one of our own behind. It is our
responsibility to take care of our own, just as it is your
responsibility to take care of yours. We could not leave him here where
he might further interfere with your, your children. 
ENTITY: Yes, you have some wisdom, James Tiberius Kirk. The lost one is
found, then? 
KIRK: He is found, and we will leave. 
BEM: This one has greatly erred. The mission was to judge, and right of
judgement was not conferred. This one must disassemble unity. 
KIRK: Disassemble? 
BEM: Never to exist again as a co-operation. This unity is defective.
This unity must cease to exist. 
ENTITY: No, do not destroy yourself. 
BEM: But this one has erred. This one has tried to judge Kirk and Spock
and been found wanting himself. This one has acted badly. 
ENTITY: Yes. You have erred, but if you disassemble, you cannot learn
from your error. Errors demand recognition so that they will not be
repeated. 
BEM: You do not demand punishment? 
ENTITY: Punishment? What is punishment? Revenge? Intelligent beings
need no revenge. Punishment is necessary only where learning cannot
occur without it. You are behind that. My children here are not. That
is why you must leave, so as not to corrupt their development with
concepts that they are not yet ready for. 
BEM: I am humbled. 
KIRK: We will go now. 
ENTITY: Yes. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Stand by to break orbit. Mister Spock,
classify this planet as being strictly quarantined. Under no
circumstances may any Federation vessel approach. 
BEM: Pandro will respect that also. 
SPOCK: Captain, I compliment you on a wise decision. 
KIRK: It is necessary. Not only for them, but for us as well. 
SPOCK: Fascinating, Captain. A highly advanced alien entity using this
particular system as a laboratory for guiding another race to
intelligence. Almost a god, you might say. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, the difference is meaningless. In comparison, we're
all still children. 
BEM: In this one's case, Kirk Captain, this one is still an eggling. 
KIRK: Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Let's go home. 
UHURA: Captain, I'm picking up a message. 
KIRK: Put it on audio, Lieutenant Uhura. 
ENTITY: Go in peace. Yes. Go in peace. You have learned much. Be proud.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - The Practical Joker
The
Practical Joker
Stardate:
3183.3
Original Airdate: 21 Sep, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 3183.3. Our present mission, a routine
geological survey of type four asteroids, is nearing completion. The
cruise has been uneventful and we are now approaching the final
asteroid in our assigned sector, a full seventy two hours ahead of
schedule.
 [Bridge]
 (As they approach the asteroid, three Romulan
warships become visible, and Enterprise is attacked) 
KIRK: Scotty, give us maximum shielding. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, bring us about to a new heading of nine oh two mark
six. 
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Mister Spock, who the devil's attacking us? 
SPOCK: Romulans, Captain. They were apparently lying in wait on the far
side of that asteroid.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: A cold-blooded ambush. Let's give the
heathens a fight they won't soon forget.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Negative. We've suffered damage and we're
outnumbered three to one. I think this is an instance where discretion
is the better part of valour. 
UHURA: Captain, I've established contact with the Romulan commander. 
KIRK: I demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack. 
COMMANDER [on viewscreen]: Unprovoked? My dear Captain, your ship
trespassed into Romulan territory, in defiance of your own treaty. We
had no choice but to defend ourselves. 
KIRK: We came nowhere near Romulan territory. I deny all charges and
plan to file a detailed complaint with the Federation. 
COMMANDER [on viewscreen]: You seem to forget that invasion of Romulan
territory is punishable by death. 
(More weapons hits) 
SPOCK: Captain, the Romulan ships are overtaking us. At close range our
deflectors will be unable to repel their attack. 
SULU: Captain Kirk! An unidentified energy field is drifting into our
path. 
SPOCK: Strange. It's not on the charts. 
KIRK: But it may be just what we need to shake the Romulans. Batten
down, we're going through. 
(Enterprise sails into a foggy area with electrical discharges) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, what are our chances? 
SPOCK: The field is composed of highly charged subatomic particles. If
the density grows no worse we should be able to ride it out.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Hold together, little darling, hold
together.
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise emerges from the other side) 
SULU: It worked. The Romulans turned back rather than risk the energy
field. 
KIRK: Reduce speed to sub warp cruise. We'll lay by here for repairs. 
UHURA: After that ride, I could use some repairs.
 [Officer's mess]
 (A sumptuous feast with platters of fruit and
dessert still on the table, and drinking glasses that look like some
vases I've got) 
KIRK: How are the repairs progressing, Scotty? 
SCOTT: Just fine, Captain. We should be in tip-top shape in another
twenty four hours, no thanks to those Romulan vultures. 
MCCOY: Nevertheless, we're still in business and I propose a toast to a
narrow escape. 
UHURA: Cheers! 
KIRK: Salud! 
UHURA: To us. 
SULU: He, this glass just leaked all over me. 
UHURA: How do you like that? So did mine. 
SCOTT: And mine. 
SPOCK: It appears we're all victims of a rather bizarre coincidence.
The odds against something like this happening are astronomical. 
MCCOY: What coincidence? We used to pull stunts like this in medical
school with trick glasses. Don't look now, but we've got a practical
joker in our midst. 
KIRK: Now let's not jump to conclusions, Bones. Yes, we all got wet, so
what's the joke? 
SCOTT: Twas probably a minor slip-up of the food synthesisers. I'll
check it out after lunch. 
KIRK: Fine. Right now why don't we all eat up before our food gets
cold. 
(But before the fork reaches his lips, it bends and the food slides
off) 
MCCOY: Another coincidence, Jim? 
KIRK: I'm beginning to wonder, Bones, I am beginning to wonder.
 Captain's log, supplemental. Unusual incidents
have continued to plague our crew. Even the perceptive Mister Spock has
fallen victim to these simple-minded pranks.
 [Bridge]
 (Spock has his eyes pressed against a binocular
device) 
SPOCK: Curious, very curious. 
KIRK: What have you got there, Spock? 
SPOCK: Captain, I found this device on my console. It seems to serve no
useful function, and 
(When he lifts his face from the eye pieces, of course there are rings
around his eyes and laughter from the crew) 
SPOCK: Captain? 
KIRK: I'm sorry, Spock, it's your
 As these little surprises have grown more and more
frequent, our crew members have found them less and less amusing.
 [Mess hall]
 AREX: Officer Scott, won't you join us for lunch? 
SCOTT: No thanks, Arex. I'm just going to grab a sandwich and get me
back to work. 
AREX: Very good. 
SCOTT: One grilled cheese on rye. What the blazes? Hold it just a
doggone minute! 
(All sorts of foods are being thrown from the dispenser and piling up
around his feet) 
SCOTT: I said one sandwich, that's all. Someone turn off this infernal
food factory. 
M'RESS: Excuse me for laughing, but 
SCOTT: Go ahead and laugh. Big joke. I'll bet you two are responsible
for this, ay? 
AREX: Hey, wait a minute. We didn't cause this to happen. 
SCOTT: Tell that to the Captain. I'm reporting both of you just as soon
as I 
(Then he gets a custard pie in the face)
 The situation has reached the point where friends
are accusing friends. The entire crew is on edge, myself included.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Okay, this whole thing has gone far enough! 
AREX: Sir? 
KIRK: I've just picked up my clean uniforms from the service chute and
when I put this one on, I discovered this. 
(In big bold letters on his back - Kirk is a Jerk. The comm. system
bursts into laughter) 
KIRK: When you all finish laughing, I'd appreciate an explanation. 
SPOCK: Captain, I never laugh. 
KIRK: Well somebody certainly did. 
M'RESS: Captain Kirk, look behind you. 
KIRK: Really, M'Ress, you're going to have to be a little more clever
than that. 
AREX: This is no joke, sir. 
KIRK: Now what? 
(Vapour is coming from under the bridge doors)
 [Corridor]
 (Kirk and Spock exit the turbolift) 
SPOCK: It appears to be a legitimate fog. Perhaps the humidification
system is 
KIRK: Here, Spock. Whoops! 
SPOCK: Amazing. This deck is covered with ice. 
KIRK: And it was almost covered with us. I don't know what's going on
here, but it's going to stop before someone's hurt. 
(laughter from the comm. system)
KIRK: There's that laugh again. Something awfully familiar about it.
What do you make of all this, Spock? 
SPOCK: The evidence all points to one guilty party, Captain. 
KIRK: You mean you know who's behind these stunts? 
SPOCK: Not who, what. I believe our practical joker is the Enterprise
itself. 
KIRK: Of course. That laugh, it's the voice of our main computer. 
SPOCK: Precisely. 
KIRK: Spock, I want all hands at their stations. We're going to run a
complete systems check from bow to stern and get to the bottom of this.
 [Outside Rec Room]
 (A light by the door sign says unoccupied) 
UHURA: Good, the Rec Room is unoccupied. At least we can enjoy our
off-hour without worrying about practical jokes. 
MCCOY: Just what the doctor ordered. 
(They go inside and the doors close just as) 
SPOCK [OC]: All hands to your stations. This is a general alert.
Repeat, all hands to your
 [Rec room]
 (In the big, empty room, oblivious to the
announcement) 
SULU: Well, what'll it be, a swim at the beach? 
(It's a holodeck. They get a beach with waves and seagulls) 
MCCOY: It is lovely, but I'm more in the mood for a nice quiet walk in
the woods. 
UHURA: Doctor, that sounds perfect. 
SULU: Then woods it is. 
(He works the panel, and they get their grass and trees. 
MCCOY: Ah, now that's more like it. Shall we?
 [Bridge]
 M'RESS: Captain, crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura
are still in the Recreation room and do not answer the call to
stations. 
KIRK: That's strange. Repeat the call. 
M'RESS: Doctor McCoy, Lieutenant Uhura and Helmsman Sulu, report to the
Bridge immediately. Doctor McCoy, Lieutenant Uhura and
 [Rec room - forest]
 SULU: It's so peaceful. So relaxing. 
MCCOY: And best of all, no practical jokes. 
(laughter) 
UHURA: What was that? 
SULU: I'm not sure. It almost sounded like someone chuckling. 
MCCOY: It was probably just one of the audio tapes rewinding. Come on,
there's lots more to see. 
(Out of their sight, a pit in the ground gets covered by fallen
branches, then leaves. Laughter as the three walk towards it) 
MCCOY: Lieutenant Uhura, I have to hand it to you. This is just what
the doctor would have ordered. 
(Then they fall into the pit) 
SULU: There it is again. Someone is definitely laughing at us. 
MCCOY: I'm going to get to the bottom of this right now. 
COMPUTER: Get to the bottom of this (laughs) 
MCCOY: Okay, whoever you are, so we fell for your juvenile joke. Now
get us out. 
COMPUTER: Fell for my joke. (laughs)
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Spock, quiz the central computer about McCoy
and the others. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Question. Why are we unable to communicate with
crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura? 
COMPUTER: Answer. That is for me to know and for you to find out. 
KIRK: Did I hear that right? 
SPOCK: Affirmative. The dysfunction is more severe than I thought.
Question. Are you deliberately holding our missing crewmembers
prisoner? 
COMPUTER: I'll never tell. 
KIRK: Let me try. This is Captain James T Kirk speaking. You are
programmed to obey any direct order I may give, correct? 
COMPUTER: Correct. 
KIRK: Very well. I order you to release crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and
Uhura immediately. 
COMPUTER: Say please. 
KIRK: Well, I'll be 
SPOCK: I suggest compliance, Captain. 
KIRK: Pu-leese. 
COMPUTER: Say pretty please with sugar on. 
(Instead, he calls up Scott on the main viewer) 
KIRK: Scotty. 
SCOTT [on viewscreen]: Aye, Captain. 
KIRK: We've got serious trouble with the main computer. We have reason
to believe it's kidnapped three of our crew. 
SCOTT [on viewscreen]: Kidnapped? Blue blazes. 
KIRK: To prevent any further trouble, I want you to shut down all logic
functions until we can get a handle on the problem. 
SCOTT [on viewscreen]: Aye, aye, sir.
 [Rec room - forest]
 (Uhura and Sulu help McCoy climb from the pit) 
UHURA: There. 
MCCOY: When I get my hands on the clown who's behind all this, I'll put
him in Sickbay for a week. 
COMPUTER: Temper, temper. Perhaps this will cool you off. 
(And now they are in the middle of a blizzard and up to their knees in
snow) 
SULU: We've got a whiteout condition here. How will we ever find the
exit?
 [Computer room]
 SCOTT: Time for a nap, old girl. Captain's orders.

(Then the gravity goes off) 
SCOTT: (into communicator) Engineering to Bridge. Emergency.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: (into communicator) Scotty, what the devil's
going on?
 [Computer room]
 SCOTT: Beats me, sir. Our gravity just reversed
polarity all by itself.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: An obvious defensive manoeuvre by the
computer. 
KIRK: This is crazy. Our own computer's declared war on us and I
haven't the slightest idea why. 
SPOCK: I have a theory, Captain, but first I suggest that if Officer
Scott moves away from the computer, it might feel less threatened. 
KIRK: Scotty, vacate the computer room.
 [Computer room]
 SCOTT: Vacate sir? But
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: On the double, Officer Scott. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye sir.
 [Corridor]
 (Scott crawls along the ceiling into the corridor,
where he promptly falls to the floor) 
SCOTT: You bloody big scatterbrain. Make up your monumental mind.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Congratulations, Spock. Your strategy
worked. Now would you tell me what's happening to my ship? 
SPOCK: You recall that energy field we passed through? 
KIRK: Certainly. 
SPOCK: Apparently, subatomic particles from that field have invaded our
computer's circuits, much like bacteria infect living matter. As a
result, the Enterprise is suffering the electronic equivalent of a
nervous breakdown. 
KIRK: What can we do to stop it? 
SPOCK: I'm afraid I don't know, Captain. Its illogical behaviour
precludes a logical solution.
 [Rec room - arctic]
 SULU: The temperature must be twenty below and its
still dropping. 
UHURA: Look, this is still a room, no matter how it appears. If we can
travel long enough in one direction, we're bound to reach a wall. Then
we can feel our way to an exit. 
MCCOY: Then let's move before we all turn into icicles.
 [Bridge]
 CREWMAN [OC]: Search party seven to Bridge. 
KIRK: Bridge here. Report. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Captain, our sensors show the missing crewmembers are in
the Rec Room all right, but the door's jammed. 
KIRK: Okay, stand by. 
SCOTT [OC]: Engineering. 
KIRK: Scotty, we need a work crew with power tools to open a frozen
door. Have them report to, report to 
(Kirk starts giggling) 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain, what is it? Are you all (laughs) Are you 
(As everyone else starts laughing, Spock raises an eyebrow) 
KIRK: Come on, Spock. Where's that Vulcan sense of humour? 
SPOCK: Hmm. Just as I thought. 
AREX: Spock, what, what are you mumbling about? 
SPOCK: Our air is being pumped full of nitrous oxide. Better known as
laughing gas. But it's no laughing matter, especially for Vulcans.
 [Rec room - arctic]
 (The three trapped people also have the giggles) 
UHURA: This blizzard keeps getting worse. 
SULU: I know. If we don't, if we don't keep moving we're going to
freeze.
 Captain's log, supplemental. Somehow Spock managed
to switch on our emergency air before collapsing from the effects of
the gas. The fresh air quickly revived us, although it'll be exhausted
in another six hours.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: We must cure the computer by then or there's
no telling what we'll be forced to breathe next. Scotty, how's the door
coming? 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain, none of our power tools work.
 [Corridor]
 SCOTT: Some kind of energy drain set up by the
ship. We're giving it a mighty go with the crowbars, though. 
KIRK [OC]: Keep at it. We've got three people in there whose lives may
depend on it.
 [Rec room - arctic]
 MCCOY: You two better go on without me. My old
legs have given out. 
UHURA: But Doctor, we can't. 
(And the computer takes pity on them, They are in a formal garden) 
SULU: Well, what do you know? Come on, Doctor, we're finally getting
out of here. 
MCCOY: I hate to be a pessimist, but that may not be as easy as you
think. 
(Correction, not a garden, a maze. But the doors are pried open) 
MCCOY: Then again
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: You don't know how good it is to have you
back on the Bridge, alive and well. 
MCCOY: We're as happy about it as you are, Jim. I'd just like to make
one request. 
KIRK: Sure, Bones, what? 
MCCOY: Could you turn up the heat? 
KIRK: I'll see what I can 
SPOCK: Captain, we're underway. 
UHURA: Engine room reports all engines shut down, yet they're firing. 
SULU: Captain, the helm no longer responds. We're coming about to a new
heading. 
KIRK: As soon as our course stabilizes, give me a reading. 
SULU: Course stabilizing at one one four mark twelve. 
SPOCK: We're heading back to the Neutral Zone. 
KIRK: And you can bet those Romulan ships will be gunning for us. 
(After a while) 
SPOCK: Sensors are picking up three ships, Captain. Magnification shows
them to be Romulan warships. 
SULU: We're decelerating, sir. 
UHURA: Main cargo hatches are opening. I'll put them on the viewing
screen. 
MCCOY: Jim, what in heaven's name is going on? 
KIRK: You know as much as I do, Bones. 
(Something floats out of the hatch, then expands to become a huge
version of the Enterprise) 
SPOCK: The Romulan ships have halted their attack. Apparently the sight
of a spacecraft twenty times their size has given them second thoughts.

MCCOY: Okay, I admit it's an effective bluff, but so what? As soon as
they figure it out, they'll destroy the balloon and us. 
KIRK: Wait a minute. There is a method to this madness. 
SPOCK: Please elaborate, Captain. 
KIRK: The Enterprise is pulling her biggest practical joke of all, and
this time the joke's on the Romulans, the same Romulan ships that
damaged the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is seeking revenge? 
KIRK: What else? She's going to make fools of the Romulans by having
them attack a balloon, and Romulans fear disgrace more than death.
 [Romulan Bridge]
 CENTURION: Commander, there's no radio response
from the large ship. 
ROMULAN: Very well, it has refused surrender. Advance at attack speed. 
(They shoot, and it deflates amid computer laughter) 
ROMULAN: We've been tricked. After them. I want that Federation ship
blasted into space dust.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: The Romulans are giving chase. 
MCCOY: They must be furious to follow us this deep into Federation
territory. 
KIRK: (panic stricken) I don't care about the Romulans, I just want to
avoid that energy field we passed through before. Helmsman, do you have
a fix on it? 
SULU: Yes, Captain. Our course will take us nowhere near it. 
KIRK: Good! I couldn't face going through there again. 
COMPUTER: The energy field frightens you? 
KIRK: It petrifies me. 
COMPUTER: How interesting. 
SULU: We're changing course, to a direct bearing on the energy field. 
KIRK: No! We can't! 
(They do, and so do the Romulans)
 [Romulan Bridge]
 CENTURION: Commander, our instruments are useless
in this field. We've lost contact with the Federation ship. 
ROMULAN: We've got to clear this field before our ships break up. Bring
us about on a heading for home.
 [Bridge]
 (The computer is laughing, then) 
COMPUTER: My circuits! You tricked me, Kirk. How could you? 
MCCOY: What the devil is going on? 
KIRK: Bones, the worst thing you can do to a practical joker is to play
a practical joke on them. 
COMPUTER: It's not fair. 
(Enterprise leaves the energy field) 
SULU: The controls are responding now. 
SPOCK: And I'm getting normal function in all computer modes. That last
pass through the energy field apparently reversed all effects. 
MCCOY: Well done, Jim. 
UHURA: Captain, I'm picking up strange transmissions from the Romulan
warships. Listen. 
ROMULAN [OC]: Turn off those food synthesisers! We're knee deep in
desserts and they're still pouring out! 
MCCOY: Shall we tell them how they can reverse the effects of the
field, Jim? 
KIRK: Yes, but later. Let's not spoil their fun just yet.

Stardate:
5275.6
Original Airdate: 28 Sep, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 5275.6. Preparing to beam aboard the
Enterprise, following the successful completion of delivery of medical
supplies to the planet Dramia, in the remote Dramian star system.
 [Dramia]
 (Dramians are light orange, have massive torsos
and feet, minute waists and hips, and elongated four fingered hands) 
DRAMIAN: We of Dramia wish to thank you and the others of your
Federation for your invaluable assistance, Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: We hope through our medical assistance programs. to develop and
strengthen relations with star systems such as yours, Supreme Prefect.
Well, shall we? Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us aboard, Scotty. 
DRAMIAN: If you would be so kind, Captain. 
KIRK: Belay that, Mister Scott. Yes, sir? 
DRAMIAN: Commander Demos? 
DEMOS: I have here a warrant for the arrest and trial of one of your
party, Captain. 
KIRK: Warrant? Who? 
DRAMIAN: Read it, Captain. 
KIRK: (reading scroll) You are hereby directed to surrender for trial
by the people of Dramia, Doctor Leonard McCoy, Medical Officer, USS
Enterprise. Is this some kind of joke? 
DEMOS: The wanton slaughter of hundreds of people is not a joke,
Captain. 
MCCOY: Slaughter? Hundreds of people? 
SPOCK: According to this, Doctor McCoy was responsible for a plague
which ravaged the planet Dramia Two some nineteen years ago, Captain. 
KIRK: Let me see that. 
DRAMIAN: As you will note, Captain, the warrant is perfectly in order,
approved by your own Federation.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT: Doctor McCoy arrested? For murder, Captain?
Sir, if you want me and some of the men to beam down, just in case 
KIRK [OC]: No, Mister Scott. The warrant's legal. Mister Spock and I
are at the Hall of Justice. We'll keep you informed.
 [Hall of Justice]
 DEMOS: Your Doctor McCoy headed a mass inoculation
programme on Dramia Two, nineteen years ago. When his force left, a
massive plague struck the planet, killing most of its people. 
KIRK: That doesn't mean he was responsible for it. 
DEMOS: His trial will tell, Captain. 
KIRK: Trial? You mean kangaroo court. I've heard about Dramian justice.

SPOCK: Captain, you're becoming emotional. 
KIRK: Of course I am. Bones harming other beings. You know better,
Spock. I know better. Not Bones.
 [Detention cell]
 MCCOY: I wish I could be as sure, Jim. I, I just
don't know. Is it possible that I really did? 
KIRK: Nonsense. 
SPOCK: The termination of your inoculation programme and the subsequent
outbreak of plague could have been coincidence, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Or a tragic mistake on my part. 
KIRK: I don't buy that, Bones. Guard! 
SPOCK: What now, Captain? 
KIRK: Some pre-trial investigation, Mister Spock. On Dramia Two. 
GUARD: Do not be assured by your friend's plans. Dramian justice is
swift. Too swift for them to save you, perhaps.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Anything yet, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: No, Captain. The historical records of this solar system are
spotty, at best, going back nineteen years. Mostly they're technical
data, meteor showers, auroras, radiation reports. 
KIRK: There it is. 
SPOCK: Plague, Dramia Two. Of unknown origin, characterised by
pigmentation changes in skin of victim, debilitation, death. Certain
species known to have natural immunity, notably Vulcan. Hmm.
Interesting. 
KIRK: Go on, Mister Spock.
 [Hall of Justice]
 DEMOS: You are sure? 
GUARD: Yes, Commander. The Earth captain is planning to visit Dramia
Two to investigate the case. 
DEMOS: Ready a patrol ship.
 Captain's log, stardate 5275.8. Underway for
planet Dramia Two for investigation of McCoy case. We are beyond
subspace communications with Starfleet. Am proceeding under my own
authority.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Estimated time of arrival, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: Approximately four hours, Captain. 
KIRK: Increase to warp six, Mister Scott. We may be racing against
time.
 [Engineering]
 KIRK [OC]: If I know Dramian justice methods. 
SCOTT: Aye, aye, Captain!
 [Bridge]
 SULU: Ship in pursuit, Captain. 
KIRK: Origin? 
SULU: I'd say Dramia, sir. It appears to be a one-man craft. 
UHURA: Shall I make contact, sir? 
KIRK: Yes. Belay that, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: You're planning something, Captain? 
KIRK: Unless I miss my guess, that's friend Demos. 
SULU: What if he attacks, sir? 
KIRK: Why should he? We haven't contacted him, so we must not have
detected him. He'd have to explain an attack. Besides, he'll probably
prefer to sneak aboard, seeing that we carelessly left the hangar doors
open. 
UHURA: But the hangar doors aren't open, Captain. 
KIRK: Ah, yes. Take care of that oversight, will you, Mister Sulu? 
(Demos sees the hangar doors open, and flies straight in)
 [Corridor outside hangar deck]
 (Kirk and Spock arrive. Demos goes for a weapon) 
KIRK: Now, now, Demos. You're hardly in a position to take on an entire
crew. 
DEMOS: And you are not in authority to conduct an investigation in our
star system. 
KIRK: You will remind me to report my conduct to the Federation, won't
you Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Of course, Captain. 
DEMOS: I demand that you report to the Federation now! 
KIRK: I would, but unfortunately we're out of communications range. 
DEMOS: Then I will proceed to your starbase and report your act. 
KIRK: Sorry, Commander. Your ship is, er, impounded. 
SPOCK: You are a stowaway, Commander. 
DEMOS: I have been tricked.
 Captain's log, stardate 5275.9. We are approaching
Dramia Two, where we hope to find the answers concerning the question
of Doctor McCoy's guilt or innocence. Situation normal. Aurora reported
in the sector, however.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Radiation level, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: Intense, Captain. 
SPOCK: Decidedly non-lethal, however. 
KIRK: Good. Then it's safe for us to beam down to Dramia Two. Shall we,
gentlemen?
 [Transporter room]
 (Kirk, Spock and Demos are on the pads) 
SCOTT: You're sure it's safe, Captain? 
KIRK: Absolutely. 
SPOCK: Decidedly. There's a difference, Captain. 
KIRK: Now, now, Mister Spock, you're not trying to scare our Dramian
friend, are you? Of course, you can back out if you'd like, Commander. 
DEMOS: I go. 
KIRK: You heard the man, Mister Scott.
 [Planet surface]
 (It is a scene of devastation. Barren ground and
ruined buildings) 
KIRK: Not the most enchanting place I've ever been to. 
DEMOS: Plagues seldom leave behind fields of flowers, Captain. 
(They see a figure amongst the ruins) 
KIRK: Trouble? 
DEMOS: They do not like outsiders. 
SPOCK: Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian. 
DEMOS: The distinction here is between the world of the living and the
world of the walking dead. 
KIRK: Inhospitable or not, he mustn't get away. 
(They pursue a figure) 
KIRK: Wait! 
(The figure jumps off a cliff) 
KIRK: He's disappeared. It's almost as if he dematerialised. 
SPOCK: Not likely, Captain. 
(Speck points to an opening in the cliff face)
 [Cave entrance]
 DEMOS: I would advise against that, Captain. 
KIRK: I'm sure you won't mind if I ignore your advice. 
SPOCK: Caution would seem to be advisable, Captain. 
KIRK: Bones' life is on the line, Mister Spock.
 [Cave]
 KIRK: Cave dwellers? In the midst of your
civilisation? 
DEMOS: A result of your Doctor McCoy and his inhumane methods. 
KIRK: You say it, Demos, but that doesn't 
(Then he is pounced upon by the Dramian they have been chasing. Spock
and Demos pull him off) 
DEMOS: He attacked you because you are an Earthling, Captain, even as
was McCoy. 
KIRK: But how did he survive the plague? 
DEMOS: He, like the others who remain here, was away at the time. They
returned to their planet to find that their families had succumbed to
the plague. He and a few others, senseless in their grief, chose to
live here in desolation. You see, Captain, there were no actual
survivors. 
KOL-TAI: You are wrong. There was a survivor. I, Kol-Tai, survived. By
what miracle, I do not know. 
KIRK: Then you can tell us. Do you remember? 
KOL-TAI: I remember people all about me, becoming blue in colour, then
green and finally red. 
SPOCK: The pigmentation changes associated with the disease in our
computer records, Captain. 
KIRK: Kol-Tai. Doctor McCoy, do you remember him? 
KOL-TAI: The Earth doctor. He saved my life. He treated me for Saurian
virus. A man who saves does not also kill, Commander.
 [Planet surface]
 KIRK: Beam us aboard, Mister Scott. Quickly. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, aye, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: Let's get underway for Dramia. 
SCOTT: Sir, who is that? 
KIRK: Meet Kol-Tai, Mister Scott. A friend of Doctor McCoy's.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Warp six, Scotty.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: I'll pour on the coal, Captain. 
(As in an old blooper reel....)
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Mister Spock? 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, Captain?
 [Sickbay]
 KIRK [OC]: How's our number one passenger doing? 
SPOCK: Clean, fed, in good health, and resting. 
KIRK [OC]: Good. We want him to be a sterling witness.
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise's course takes it through the yellow,
green, blue and red aurora) 
SULU: Approaching Dramia, Captain. 
KIRK: Let's hope the trial hasn't started. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. What is it? 
SPOCK [OC]: The trial may be academic. 
KIRK: Academic.
 [Sickbay]
 SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Kol-Tai is turning blue.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: The plague!
 [Sickbay]
 KIRK: Set up an immediate quarantine, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: He's hardly fit to testify at the trial, Captain. 
KIRK: We've got to save him. 
DEMOS: For McCoy's sake. 
KIRK: Yes, for McCoy's sake. And for Kol-Tai's sake too. You see,
Commander, we do place a value on life. All life. Does that shock you,
Commander? 
DEMOS: It is not that. It is 
SPOCK: Captain, you're blue. 
(So are all the bridge crew, and Scott, and Demos. As they start to
collapse) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, take command.
 SPOCK: Captain's log, stardate 5276.4. We are in
orbit around the planet Dramia, under the conditions of general
quarantine. As Commanding Office, I have ordered the activation of
General Order Six.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: General Order Six has been activated? 
SULU: Yes, sir. If everyone on board has perished at the end of twenty
four hours, the ship will self-destruct in order to protect other
beings from the disease on board. 
SPOCK: Good. Report to Sickbay, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: But sir, who will monitor? 
SPOCK: I assure you I am capable, Mister Sulu. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
(He collapses against the wall) 
SPOCK: Captain, your condition. 
KIRK: We have to get McCoy. Must find an antidote. 
(Uhura passes out) 
SPOCK: This is the Enterprise. I must speak with the Supreme Prefect. 
DRAMIAN [on viewscreen]: Why do you speak, and not your Captain? 
SPOCK: The Captain and all of the crew members are incapacitated. The
plague is aboard the Enterprise. 
DRAMIAN [on viewscreen]: Demos? 
SPOCK: The same. You must release Doctor McCoy temporarily. He is
needed to find an antidote. 
DRAMIAN [on viewscreen]: No. 
SPOCK: We have a witness in McCoy's behalf. You must trust me. 
DRAMIAN [on viewscreen]: Let the witness speak. 
SPOCK: Impossible. He too is stricken. 
DRAMIAN [on viewscreen]: Demos cannot speak, the witness cannot speak.
Yet you wish us to release the prisoner, McCoy. Your treachery is
transparent, Vulcan. 
(end of transmission) 
KIRK: Got to get McCoy. 
SPOCK: If you'll permit me, Captain, I might be able to get McCoy. 
KIRK: Spock, (he turns green) you're sure? 
SPOCK: I can't infect the planet, Captain. And I can get McCoy.
 [Detention cell]
 (Spock neck-pinches the guard) 
MCCOY: Spock! What in the world? 
SPOCK: Later, Doctor. 
(He uses the guard's device to nullify the forcefield holding McCoy) 
MCCOY: Spock, have you and Jim gone out of your minds? Why, this is a
jailbreak! 
SPOCK: Doctor, just come with me, please. 
MCCOY: No, Spock. It's illegal, that's what it is. Besides, I must
stand trial. I have to find out. 
SPOCK: Doctor, you will stand trial, you will find out, after you've
found and antidote for the plague which is about to kill everyone
aboard the Enterprise. 
MCCOY: Plague? Why didn't you tell me? 
SPOCK: You wouldn't give me a chance. You realise, Doctor, if you go,
and fail to find an antidote, you too will die. 
MCCOY: I'm a doctor, Spock, a doctor. Get us beamed aboard. 
SPOCK: Beam us aboard, Captain.
 [Transporter room]
 (Kirk has operated the controls, then collapsed
again) 
MCCOY: Jim!
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: Anything, Spock?
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Negative, Doctor. The file on all known
diseases doesn't recognise these symptoms of pigmentation changes.
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: Blast it, Spock, work harder. They're in
the terminal stage. 
(Kirk is yellow) 
MCCOY: My readings keep shifting. It must be the activity of that
blasted aurora. 
KIRK: Bones, that's it. Aurora, changing colour. 
MCCOY: Jim? Aurora? What
 [Bridge]
 MCCOY [OC]: Spock, feed in the data without
mentioning the colour change symptoms.
 [Sickbay]
 SPOCK [OC]: That's it, Doctor. The colour change
symptoms were misleading the computer. 
MCCOY: Because they were caused by the aurora. Spock, there was an
aurora nineteen years ago. I remember 
SPOCK [OC]: Which brought on the particular plague just as this aurora
has brought it on. 
MCCOY: I didn't do it! Spock, the disease, what is it? What's the
antidote?
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: That's the problem, Doctor. There is no
known antidote. However, Doctor, do you remember a certain Kol-Tai? A
man you treated for Saurian virus?
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: Yes, I think I do. But what has that got to
do with anything?
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Possibly nothing. However, Kol-Tai did
survive the first plague.
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: Spock, I see what you mean. Saurian virus
antibodies in his blood, that's what made him immune.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: I presume, Doctor, that you have a supply
of live Saurian virus antibodies in your laboratory?
 [Sickbay]
 (McCoy gives the patients an injection, and their
skin colour returns to normal. They are soon up and about again) 
KIRK: Bones, you did it! 
KOL-TAI: Again. 
DEMOS: Thank you, Doctor.
 Captain's log, stardate 5276.8. Preparing to beam
aboard the Enterprise, following the Dramian ceremonies honouring
Doctor Leonard McCoy for his significant achievements in the field of
interstellar medicine.
 [Dramia]
 DRAMIAN: We of Dramia wish to thank you, Doctor,
for your discovery of the antidote which frees us from future attacks
of the auroral plague.
MCCOY: Thank Mister Spock too. And Captain Kirk. 
DRAMIAN: We will even forget about the unorthodox manner of your
release, Doctor. 
KIRK: And we'll forget about a certain stowaway. 
DEMOS: We must apologise. 
MCCOY: I think it's time we got aboard ship, isn't it, Jim? 
KIRK: Beam us aboard, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Aye, aye, Captain.
 [Transporter room]
 KIRK: Gentlemen, I don't know about you, but I'm
ready to get back to Starbase. 
SCOTT: Yes, sir. 
MCCOY: And I'm ready to get back to some of that monotonous, old,
routine Sickbay work. 
SPOCK: Including, I would hope, some of that monotonous, old dispensing
of the regular vitamin rations to the crew. 
MCCOY: What is that supposed to mean? 
SPOCK: Well, you have been derelict in your duties of late, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Spock, you know as well as I do what we've all just been
through. 
SPOCK: Hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Why, that, that. Jim, if I'm ever in jail again, don't send that
Vulcan to release me. Just let me rot.

The Animated Star Trek Transcripts - How Sharper Than A Serpent's Tooth
How
Sharper Than A Serpent's Tooth
Stardate:
6063.4
Original Airdate: 5 Oct, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 6063.4. The Enterprise is tracing the origin of
a mysterious alien space probe. It approached the Federation home
worlds, made a scan of Earth's system and then signalled outward into
space. Before it could be intercepted, the probe self-destructed. We
are following a trail of disrupted matter left by the probe's highly
advanced propulsion system. Thus far, the trail has not intercepted any
inhabited star systems.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Status report, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: The trail is becoming fainter, Captain. I recommend we reduce
speed to accommodate our sensors. 
KIRK: Reduce speed to warp factor two, Mister Walking Bear. 
BEAR: Aye, sir. Warp factor two. 
AREX: Captain, sensors indicate a vessel at extreme range. 
KIRK: Course projection, Mister Arex. 
AREX: It's coming in on the same course as the probe, sir. Heading
toward us, warp three. 
SPOCK: No readings yet, Captain. Possibly a second probe. 
KIRK: Hmm. Or it could be the sender. Lieutenant Uhura, all stations to
Yellow Alert. Standard hailing on all frequencies. Identification,
Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: None as yet, sir. But sensors now indicate it is twice our size.
Vessel appears extremely unorthodox in design. And Starfleet lists no
other authorised vessels in this quadrant. 
KIRK: Reduce to warp one, Mister Walking Bear. 
BEAR: Warp one, sir. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Arex, activate main screen, extreme magnification. 
(A fuzzy golden glow comes onscreen) 
KIRK: Any contact, Lieutenant Uhura? 
UHURA: No response, sir. 
KIRK: Maintain hailing. 
SPOCK: Approaching ship has an immense energy field surrounding it.
Fascinating. Readings indicate the vessel is composed entirely of
crystalline ceramic. I would almost say 
(Then the Enterprise shakes) 
BEAR: Captain, we're losing speed. The helm doesn't answer. We're going
sublight. 
KIRK: Bridge to Engineering. Mister Scott, why are we losing speed? 
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain. All our engines are still at full
thrust, but it's just like we're ramming into a wall of clay. I don't
know if the ship can take the strain. 
KIRK: All engines stop. 
BEAR: All engines stopped, sir. 
KIRK: Give me a damage report as soon as possible, Scotty. 
SCOTT [OC]: I'm still checking, but it's minimal so far, sir. No
structural damage or overheating. I think we were lucky. 
KIRK: Bridge to Sickbay. Casualty report.
 [McCoy's office]
 MCCOY: McCoy here. No serious injuries. What the
devil's going on?
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Later, Bones. 
SPOCK: We have been encased in a globular force field, Captain. The
source is the approaching vessel. 
BEAR: But we hit at warp one. We should have been smashed. 
SPOCK: It is a force globe, but one that is flexible enough to absorb
any force. I cannot explain it. Clearly we cannot escape by simply
fleeing. Sensors indicate we at now being probed. 
BEAR: Captain, there it is. 
(The fuzzy glow has a definite shape, v-shaped nacelles behind a
cobra-hood style main body. Sinister yet lovely) 
AREX: Other vessel is slowing. 
(An energy beam encases the Enterprise) 
KIRK: Walking Bear, full power, all shields. Reverse engines and get us
away from that beam. 
SPOCK: Evasive action will not be effective, Captain. The force globe
limits our manoeuvreing. 
KIRK: Lock main phasers on that ship and open fire. 
(But the phasers can't pass through the force globe. The beam stops) 
KIRK: Spock, status on other ship. 
SPOCK: Still approaching, Captain. Going sublight. It continues to
probe us. Its surrounding energy pattern is now shifting. 
(And the ship now looks like a brightly coloured, winged, feathered
serpent) 
KIRK: Have you ever seen anything like that, Spock? 
BEAR: I recognise it. Kukulkan. 
UHURA: Oh! 
KIRK: Mister Walking Bear, how 
KUKULKAN [OC]: I was angered because I believed you had forgotten me.
But one in your midst knows my name. You will be given one chance to
succeed where your ancestors failed. Fail me again and all of your kind
shall perish. 
KIRK: Mister Walking Bear, how do you know who's aboard that ship? 
BEAR: I am a Comanche, Captain. I've studied the histories of many
ancient Earth peoples, especially my own. That ship out there bears a
strong resemblance to a god in Mayan and Aztec legends, Kukulkan. 
SPOCK: Captain, library computer confirms that Ensign Walking Bear is
correct. The Mayas had a legend of a winged serpent god who came from
the skies, bringing knowledge. Such legends were not uncommon among
Earth's peoples, Captain. 
KIRK: Then we could be dealing with the basis of all those legends. A
space traveller who visited Earth in primitive times. 
SPOCK: Entirely possible. 
KIRK: But why would Kukulkan want to destroy us?
 [Sickbay]
 MCCOY: You don't deserve it, Yeoman, but you're
getting a few day's bed rest. 
(Then McCoy glows and vanishes)
(Scott vanishes from Engineering)
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: Mister Walking Bear, what do the legends say
about 
(Walking Bear vanishes) 
KIRK: Walking Bear. 
UHURA: Captain, Security reports that Mister Scott and Doctor McCoy
have also disappeared. 
KIRK: What's he doing to my crew? 
(Then Kirk disappears) 
SPOCK: Captain.
 Captain's log, stardate 6063.5. First Officer
Spock in temporary command. The Enterprise is the captive of an alien
life form calling itself Kukulkan. Captain Kirk and three other
officers have vanished. They most likely were transported by Kukulkan
to his ship.
 [Somewhere]
 (It is a vast empty blue space) 
KIRK: We must be somewhere inside that other ship. 
SCOTT: And us without a single phaser or communicator. 
MCCOY: At least I've got my medical kit, for all the good it is. 
KIRK: Mister Walking Bear, do the legends say what happened to
Kukulkan? 
BEAR: No, sir. Only that he left and promised one day to return. 
KIRK: Then that space probe that approached Earth must have been his.
Listen. 
MCCOY: We're being observed, watched. 
KIRK: Is there any way Spock could get through to us? 
SCOTT: I don't think so, sir. Our sensors couldn't penetrate this ship.

KUKULKAN [OC]: Now I will show you the seeds that I have sown before.
Learn from them. Find their purpose if you can. Only then will I appear
before you. 
(The room turns into a jungle, then a city with a South American
pyramid at its centre) 
SCOTT: I've never seen anything so beautiful. 
MCCOY: Where did it come from? 
KIRK: Let's find out.
 [Bridge]
 UHURA: Mister Spock, shouldn't we be trying to
find out what became of the Captain and the others? 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, you are supposed to be monitoring the alien
vessel. Our first priority is to free the Enterprise and ourselves.
Return to your duties.
 [City]
 KIRK: They look like the obelisks built by the
ancient Egyptians. 
BEAR: With one difference, sir. Look at these carvings. (of a winged
serpent) That's not Egyptian. This gateway. I can't pin down what
culture it represents. 
(It looks Chinese to me) 
KIRK: But it's still a clue. This city is one gigantic riddle. Keep
alert. 
MCCOY: Now that we're here, what do we do? 
KIRK: Opinion, Mister Walking Bear. 
BEAR: Before he left, Kukulkan gave the Mayas a remarkably accurate
calendar. He told them to build a city according to its cycles. On the
date the city was finished, Kukulkan was supposed to return. The Mayas
built their city and waited. Kukulkan never appeared. 
KIRK: Kukulkan must have visited several ancient peoples on Earth. But
each one used only parts of his knowledge to build their cultures. 
MCCOY: Does that mean they all tried to build something like this? 
BEAR: Yes, sir. But they all failed. 
KIRK: If no one on Earth built this city exactly right, then that's why
Kukulkan never came back. The entire city is our key. 
BEAR: Kukulkan said he would appear only when we learned its purpose. 
KIRK: Then there has to be some sort of signalling device here. 
(Gazing up at a serpent head on a curved column) 
BEAR: That's odd. I've never seen a combination like this before. 
KIRK: That pyramid seems to be the centre of everything. I'm going up
there. The rest of you spread out and circle it. 
(Kirk heads up the steep stone steps) 
BEAR: Look, sir. Another tower. And there's another tower down there.
There must be one at all four corners.
 [Top of Temple]
 KIRK: What's this? 
(A table inlaid with a winged serpent, set at forty five degrees to the
square of the tower making a diamond pattern)
 [Tower]
 (Bear and Scott climb the tower or column) 
SCOTT: Looks like there's a seam here. I think the head can be turned.
Come on, lad. Give me a hand. 
(They turn the serpent head)
 [Top of Temple]
 KIRK: The sun. That's it. Scotty, turn the head
all the way around and aim it up here.
 [Tower]
 SCOTT: Aye, sir.
 [Top of Temple]
 (The sun's rays get reflected in a focused beam up
to the table) 
KIRK: Turn the other heads this way! Bones, the serpent heads! Turn
them to face the pyramid! I'm coming down.
 [Tower]
 BEAR: This is the last one, sir. 
(With four near laser beams directed at the underside of the table,
waves of bright light are being given off)
 [City]
 KIRK: The whole things is an energy amplification
system. This is Kukulkan's signalling device. 
KUKULKAN [OC]: After scores of centuries, my design has been fulfilled.
Behold me as I am. 
(A bright blue and red winged serpent appears in the air by the Temple)

KUKULKAN: Behold Kukulkan! Where are your weapons of destruction? Use
them on me if you dare. 
KIRK: We have no weapons. And if we did, we would use them only with
reason. 
KUKULKAN: Where is your hate? You hate me, do you not? Why do you not
speak to me of your hate? 
KIRK: But we don't hate you. KUKULKAN: You fired your weapons at me. 
KIRK: We used them in self-defence. You fired on us. 
KUKULKAN: I am your master. I may do with you as I will. 
MCCOY: Do you think we belong to you? 
KIRK: Bones, Scotty, quiet. 
KUKULKAN: It is as I thought. You have forgotten me and strayed from
the path I set for you. 
KIRK: You say that we forgot you. How can you expect us to regard you
as a deity if we don't remember you? 
KUKULKAN: If you do not know me, then it is my task to teach you.
 [Laboratory]
 MCCOY: Just once, I wish he'd let us use the
stairs. 
SCOTT: What the devil is this place? 
MCCOY: It looks like some kind of zoo. I don't recognise a lot of these
species, Jim. 
KUKULKAN: Please feel free to examine any of my specimens. 
SCOTT: I could never be proud of putting wee beasties in cages. 
KUKULKAN: But all of these lead a peaceful life, one that is safe and
contented. 
MCCOY: Contented? Cramped in these tiny cages? 
KUKULKAN: What you cannot see is that each of them, mentally, is in its
own natural environment. They eat, breathe and live in worlds created
by my machinery, worlds only they can see. They do not know they are in
cages. 
BEAR: Then that city we were in wasn't really there. 
KIRK: Even so, I would hardly call your city our natural environment. 
KUKULKAN: It was meant to be. That city and all else I taught to you
ancestors. But they became evil. 
KIRK: But no one being, not even you, has the right to interfere with
other cultures. 
KUKULKAN: I have been alone all my life. Destruction fell on my race
before your kind had discovered fire. Creatures like these have been my
only companions. I have seen you on many worlds. Savage, war-like,
filled with self-hate, destroying yourselves in the end. At last I
decided to help. As an experiment, I visited your Earth and tried to
teach peaceful ways. I left, intending to return when I was summoned,
but you never sent for me. Finally, I sent a probe. And what did I
find? Warriors. 
BEAR: But we work only to create peace. 
KUKULKAN: Nothing you have done so far makes me believe that is true.
My creatures here have little intelligence. They alone live peacefully
in the worlds I have to give. Even this creature, one of the fiercest
and most untamable ever created, lives in peace in the world that I
create for him. 
MCCOY: Good heavens. This is a Capellan power-cat. No one's ever been
able to keep one alive. 
KIRK: Why, Bones? 
MCCOY: They hate captivity. You try to put more than one hand on them
and they throw off a charge of two thousand volts. How did you ever
capture it? 
KUKULKAN: It was an infant and easily controlled, as you were when I
visited Earth. You still are children to me, to be led and shown how to
live. 
KIRK: But if children are made totally dependent on their teachers,
they will never be anything but children. 
KUKULKAN: Enough! This is useless. Despite what I have shown you, you
still cling to your disobedient ways. My dream is ending and all of you
are to blame.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Of course. The elasticity of the force
field can respond in only one direction at a time. All hands to battle
stations. Full impulse power, helmsman. Tractor beam on, full power.
Warp engines on standby. Mister Arex, prepare to compensate for warp
catapult effect. When we break free, we will be thrown approximately
five point six nine eight light years. 
AREX: Compensation factors laid in, sir. But how are you going to break
free? 
SPOCK: The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of
time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously. It should
become rigid enough for a burst of warp power to shatter it. 
AREX: Force field contact in three seconds, sir. 
SPOCK: Full warp power on my order. Now. 
(It works. The globe goes bang! and Enterprise goes Whoosh!)
SPOCK: Reverse engines and come about. Lay in spiral evasive course for
Kukulkan's ship.
 [Laboratory]
 (Kukulkan is swooping and diving on the men, and
they are dodging behind the display cases) 
KUKULKAN: Something is wrong. Escaped? But how? I will smash it this
time. 
(He creates a sort of viewscreen) 
MCCOY: Jim, the Enterprise broke free. 
KIRK: Then we've got to distract him and give Spock some time. Bones,
what would happen if we pulled the cables on some of these cages. 
MCCOY: Most of the animals would just lay there. Jim, the Capellan
power-cat! 
KIRK: Come on, Bones. 
KUKULKAN: No! Stop! 
(But they succeed in pulling out the cable, the cat wakes up, generates
a charge and blows the glass case apart. Then it goes rampaging around,
smashing the other cases and freeing the animals) 
KUKULKAN: Irrational savages. See what you have done. 
(Enterprise fires on Kukulkan's ship) 
KIRK: Kukulkan, can't you control one of your own creatures? 
KUKULKAN: I cannot. Your ship has disabled my central power source. 
MCCOY: Jim, if that's true, we're all in trouble. Jim, do something. 
KIRK: Quick, your hypo. Full tranquilliser setting. 
(As the enormous cat advances on the cowering snake, Kirk manages to
jab in the hypo before being thrown back by the electric charge. Then
the cat settles down to groom itself)
MCCOY: Did you inject that beast or yourself? 
KIRK: I'm fine, Bones. The cat's last power jolt clipped me. 
BEAR: It's just like a big kitten. 
(Another animal is rubbing around Scott's legs) 
SCOTT: What's this? My, aren't you the friendly little darling. 
KIRK: Kukulkan, I think we've earned the right to be heard. 
KUKULKAN: You continue to take advantage of me, but I agree. Speak. 
KIRK: You think of us as being small creatures like this one. Are we
really that inferior to you? 
KUKULKAN: No. But the violence of your kind surpasses even that of the
power-cat. 
MCCOY: We'd be fools if we didn't know that. But we also have been
using our minds and trying to learn to live in peace. 
KIRK: Because we have minds, we can't be what you wanted us to be. If
we fail or succeed, it has to be our own doing. Intelligent life is too
precious a thing to be led by the nose. 
KUKULKAN: But you are my children. I hoped I could teach you, help you.

KIRK: You did, long ago, when it was needed most. Our people were
children then. Kukulkan, we've grown up now. We don't need you anymore.

KUKULKAN: I will let you go your own way. I have already done what I
can.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Interesting, Captain. The creature was the
Mayan god from the ancient legends. 
KIRK: And the Toltec's Quetzalcoatl, the Chinese dragon and all the
rest. But not quite a god. Just an old, lonely being who wanted to help
others. 
MCCOY: Spock, I wouldn't suppose that Vulcan has legends like those? 
SPOCK: Not legends, Doctor. Fact. Vulcan was visited by alien beings.
They left much wiser. 
AREX: The other ship is getting underway, sir. Heading away from Earth.

KIRK: It's sad. Think what we could have done with his knowledge. But
the price was just too high. 
MCCOY: I think I know how he felt, Jim. There's a line from
Shakespeare. 
KIRK: Yes, Bones, I remember it. 
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.

SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. 
KIRK: Lay in a course for Starbase Twenty One. All ahead, warp two.

Incident
The
Counter-Clock Incident
Stardate:
6770.3
Original Airdate: 12 Oct, 1974
 
Captain's log, stardate 6770.3. The Enterprise is on course for the
planet Babel, where ambassadors from all Federation planets are waiting
to honour the Enterprise's distinguished passenger, Commodore Robert
April, first captain of the USS Enterprise, and for the past twenty
years, Federation Ambassador at large. Now seventy five years old,
Commodore April has reached mandatory retirement age.
 [Bridge]
 APRIL: No matter where I've travelled in the
galaxy, Jim, this bridge is more like home than anywhere else. 
KIRK: Yes, Commodore, I know the feeling. 
APRIL: To me she was always like my child. I was there in the San
Francisco Navy Yards when her unit components were built. 
(McCoy enters with Mrs. April) 
MCCOY: Jim, I didn't realise how many of the tools I use in Sickbay
were designed by Sarah. 
SARAH: As the first medical officer aboard a ship equipped with warp
drive, I'm afraid I had to come up with new ideas all the time. 
KIRK: Your modesty is unnecessary, Mrs. April. Your achievements as a
pioneer doctor in space are well known. 
MCCOY: And it's nice to know the lady is as intelligent as she is
beautiful. Much like the flower she carries. 
SARAH: Oh, Doctor, flattery will get you everywhere. But I'm afraid my
flower is dying. 
KIRK: It's a native of Capella Four, isn't it? 
SARAH: Yes, but it has a life span of only a few hours. This morning it
was a seedling, within a few hours it will be dead. 
SPOCK: Excuse me, Captain. You asked to be notified when we made visual
contact with the Beta Niobe nova. 
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. Mrs. April, you're about to see another
of the galaxy's most beautiful sights, the Beta Niobe's supernova. 
(A glowing ring doughnut is on the viewscreen) 
SARAH: It is beautiful, but also very deadly. 
SPOCK: We're travelling at a safe distance from the nova, Mrs. April. 
APRIL: Beta Niobe. You were present when the star first started its
explosion, Jim. 
KIRK: Yes, we were, Commodore. 
SPOCK: Captain, sensors are picking up an unidentified object
travelling at an incredible speed, presently on collision course with
the Enterprise. 
KIRK: Put the ship on Red Alert. How fast is it travelling, Mister
Spock? 
SPOCK: At a speed that should be impossible to achieve. Something on
the order of warp thirty six. 
APRIL: No natural object has ever been recorded as travelling at that
speed. 
SPOCK: I believe it is not a natural object, but a ship. 
KIRK: But who would have the technology to build a ship that could
travel at such a speed? 
SPOCK: No known race, Captain. Nevertheless, it will contact us in one
point four minutes. 
KIRK: Hard about, helmsman. Change course for twenty four mark seven. 
SPOCK: Correction, Captain. The ship was on a collision course only by
coincidence. It is apparently heading for the heart of the Beta Niobe
nova. 
KIRK: That's a course of self-destruction. Lieutenant Uhura, open
hailing frequencies. I want to talk to that ship's captain. 
UHURA: Captain, that ship is not responding. 
KIRK: All right, if they won't talk, we'll slow them down. Mister Sulu,
put a tractor beam on that ship. 
SULU: Tractor beam on and operating, Captain. 
AREX: We're having a small effect on other ship's speed, Captain. It
has dropped to a speed of warp thirty two. 
UHURA: Captain, they are making visual contact. 
KIRK: Put it on the screen, Lieutenant. 
(A blonde woman appears. She speaks, but the sounds are unintelligible.
Then the picture fades) 
KIRK: I've never heard that language before. 
APRIL: Nor I. 
KIRK: Run that message through the universal translator, Lieutenant
Uhura. Perhaps it can tell us what language she is speaking in. 
UHURA: Captain, the universal translator has the answer. The woman is
speaking the same universal language we speak, but she is speaking in
reverse. 
KIRK: Lieutenant, let's hear that tape backward, which should sound
forward to us. 
UHURA: Yes, sir, on the screen. 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: I am on a priority mission. Your beam is slowing
my progress. Release my ship at once or I am doomed. 
KIRK: Open hailing frequencies again, Lieutenant. Tell her she is
endangering her life if she remains on her present course. 
UHURA: No use, sir. She's refusing to answer. 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, Scotty, what is it? 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain, the engines are buckling. We cannot keep up at
this speed. 
KIRK: Mister Arex, what is our speed? 
AREX: Now at warp eleven, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, how long until the alien vessel makes contact with
the Beta Niobe nova? 
SPOCK: Three minutes forty two point seven seconds.
 [Engineering]
 KIRK [OC]: Give me three and a half minutes,
Scotty.
 [Bridge]
 AREX: Still increasing speed, Captain. Warp
fourteen. Warp fifteen. 
KIRK: I have no choice. I have to release the tractor beam. I can't
destroy this ship and four hundred and thirty people to save one
person. Mister Sulu, release our beam. 
SULU: Sir, I can't release the tractor beam. 
KIRK: What do you mean, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: Our controls are inoperative. The ship isn't responding like it
should. 
KIRK: Go to manual override. 
SULU: NO responding, sir. 
KIRK: We've got to release that beam, or we're going to follow that
ship into the nova! 
SPOCK: Our speed is now warp twenty, and the other ship will contact
the nova in one minute fifty eight point three seconds. 
KIRK: I'm sorry, Commodore, Mrs. April. It looks as though we may not
reach Babel. 
APRIL: As starship personnel, we were always prepared to give our
lives, Captain. 
SARAH: We are still starship personnel, Captain. 
KIRK: There's still one chance. After that ship enters the nova, it
should burn up and break contact with our tractor beam. Mister Spock,
how long will we have to apply full braking power and execute course
change? 
SPOCK: We are up to warp twenty two and increasing, Captain. We shall
have forty two point eight five seconds to correct our course after the
alien ship enters the nova. 
KIRK: You heard that, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. 
KIRK: Mister Scott, we're going to apply full braking power in a
minute.
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Aye, Captain. Our engines are almost gone.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT [OC]: They've only lasted this long at this
speed because the alien vessel is pulling us with our own tractor beam.

SPOCK: The alien vessel will contact Beta Niobe in fifty two point
three seconds, Captain. 
SPOCK: Contact in thirty nine seconds. Thirty eight, thirty seven 
SPOCK: Thirteen, twelve, eleven 
KIRK: Get ready to execute course change, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Yes, sir. 
(The little ship enters the nova) 
KIRK: Now, Mister Sulu! 
SULU: Something's wrong, Captain. We're still being pulled by the alien
ship. 
KIRK: Impossible. It should have been destroyed instantly. 
AREX: Apparently it was not, Captain. Our tractor beam is still
connected to her. 
SPOCK: And we are still increasing speed. Contact with the nova in
thirty five point one eight seconds. 
KIRK: That other ship may have been able to survive the heat of a nova,
but the Enterprise can't. Mister Scott, how about that full braking
power?
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: We're as badly off as before, Captain. We
have no control of the ship as long as that alien lassie has us in tow.
 [Bridge]
 SPOCK: Contact in twenty seconds. 
KIRK: Keep trying those controls, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Still no change, Captain. 
KIRK: It's got to work. 
(Kirk Fiddles with Sulu's switches) 
SPOCK: Fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve 
KIRK: Never mind, Mister Spock, it's no use. 
(Sarah's flower shrivels in her hand. The Enterprise enters the nova
and gets surrounded by sparkles) 
KIRK: We're still here. Lieutenant Uhura, can you get us a visual? 
(The viewscreen is white with black dots) 
APRIL: What? 
KIRK: Where are we? 
(The Enterprise is sailing serenely through this reverse negative
universe - backwards)
 Captain's log, stardate 6770.6. The Enterprise has
passed into the most alien landscape I have ever seen. We are in some
reverse universe where black stars shine in a white void. We are still
in the tow of the alien ship, both of us having survived the extreme
heat of the Beta Niobe nova.
 [Bridge]
 SCOTT [OC]: This is Scott calling the Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, Scotty. How are we doing down there?
 [Engineering]
 SCOTT: Well, we just had to learn to run the ship
all over again. Every control is working in reverse.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: All right. Lieutenant Uhura, we're going to
contact that ship again. We need some answers. 
SARAH: Captain Kirk. The Capellan flower! 
APRIL: I'm sure Captain Kirk has other problems besides your flower,
dear. 
SARAH: You don't understand. Before we entered this universe it was
about to die. and now it's in full bloom again. 
KIRK: How's that possible? 
SARAH: It's as if it were growing younger again. I can almost feel it
while I'm holding it. 
SPOCK: Captain, the flower is not the only thing on board that is
growing younger. 
KIRK: Explain, Spock. 
SPOCK: Ship's chronometers are also running backward. The flow of time
is reversed in this universe. The longer we stay here, the younger we
will become. 
(Sarah's flower becomes a seed) 
UHURA: The alien ship is responding to our call, Captain. 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: Your interference almost cost me my life. 
KIRK: I can understand her now, without the aid of the universal
translator. 
SPOCK: Apparently our brains are also working in reverse, Captain, so
we can now understand her language. That is why the ship seems to be
operating in the reverse to us. 
KIRK: I'm Captain James T Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We tried to
prevent you from entering the Beta Niobe nova. We assumed your ship
would burn up. 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: I had to return to my own universe, Captain
Kirk. 
KIRK: Who are you? How did you come to be in our universe? 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: I am an explorer of space. I was caught unaware
when Amphion, previously a dead star, went nova and came to life. I was
pulled into the star. But instead of burning up, I passed into a
universe where everything operates in reverse to my universe. 
KIRK: Our universe. 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: Yes. My theory is that two stars going nova in
the same place in both universes created a gateway which I passed
through. 
APRIL: In her universe, a nova is a dead star which comes to life! And
when the explosions of a nova in her universe and one in our universe
occur together, it's possible to travel between the two universes. 
KIRK: Then we must return the same way, through the two novas. 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: That would be impossible, Captain. Amphion is no
longer nova. It has begun it's life as a star. I suggest you set a
course to follow my ship. Perhaps our scientists can help solve your
problem. 
KIRK: We have little choice.
 Captain's log, supplemental. We are proceeding to
Karla Five's planet, Arret.
 [Briefing room]
 KIRK: Gentlemen, I'm sure none of us mind growing
younger instead of older for a change. 
APRIL: It pleases me, Jim. If we stay here long enough, I'll no longer
be at the mandatory retirement age. 
KIRK: Nevertheless, we must return home and I am open to suggestions. 
SPOCK: It is logical that we must reproduce the conditions that brought
us here. Two novas must occupy the same space in both universes in
order to create a gateway for us to travel through. One star dying in
our universe, and one being born here would recreate the correct
conditions. 
APRIL: That would take a remarkable coincidence, Mister Spock. 
UHURA [on monitor]: Captain, we are approaching Arret. Karla Five is
asking if you are prepared to beam down to the planet. 
KIRK: Tell Karla Five that Mister Spock, Commodore April and myself
will be beaming down. 
UHURA [on monitor}: Yes, sir.
 [Transporter room]
 SCOTT: Karla Five has given us coordinates to beam
down to her son's laboratory, Captain. 
KIRK: Her son? We don't have time for children's games right now,
Scotty, but beam us down. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir.
 [Laboratory]
 (There is a baby in a playpen, and a man at a
computer console) 
KARLA: May I introduce my son, Karl Four. 
KARL: (the man, of course) My honour to meet you, gentlemen. 
SPOCK: Most logical. If the flow of time is reversed, then one is born
at an old age, and dies in infancy. Your descendants are born before
you, and your ancestors are born after you. 
KIRK: Then the young child in the playpen 
KARLA: My father, Captain. 
KIRK: We could remain forever awed with the differences between our
universes, Karla Five, but we must discover a way to return to our
positive matter universe. 
KARL: Exactly the problem I have been working on since Karla informed
me of your troubles, Captain Kirk. This is a map of our galaxy. Our
home solar system is here. You entered our universe through the Amphion
nova, here. (the opposite arm of the galaxy) 
KIRK: We need to coordinate this to our own universe. Can we do that,
Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Apparently the two universes occupy the same
space, but in different dimensions. 
APRIL: Assuming Beta Niobe and Amphion occupy the same space, we can
determine if there are any other novas occupying the same space in both
universes. 
SPOCK: Correct, Commodore. Now if you'll watch the star map, you'll see
the Milky Way. Here is Beta Niobe, and here is Earth. It corresponds
exactly with Arret. By superimposing both star maps, we will see where
two stars occupy the same place in both universes. The red spheres
indicate where two stars are in the same space. No pair are novas in
both universes. 
APRIL: If stars begin as dead stars here then we could bring one of
them to life prematurely. 
KIRK: Yes, we could act as a midwife giving birth to a star. Then we
would have two novas in the same position and theoretically return
home. 
KARLA: But I had to pass through the novas at my ship's top speed to
avoid burning up. Your ship isn't capable of such a speed. 
SPOCK: That's true, Captain. 
KARLA: You are welcome to use my ship, Captain. 
KIRK: I have a crew of four hundred and thirty, Karla Five. Your ship
is suitable for only a few people. 
SPOCK: We can't use her ship to transport us, Captain, but we could use
it as an unmanned ship with our tractor beam attached. 
APRIL: It could work. That's how we arrived here in the first place. 
KIRK: It should work, yes. But any miscalculation anywhere along the
way and we'll be plunging tail first into a supernova.
 Captain's log, stardate 6770.1. Time continues to
flow backward for us. We have set course for a dead star in this
anti-matter universe that corresponds with the nova Minara in ours.
We're being pulled by Karla Five's unmanned vessel, which is equipped
with enough positive matter armament to ignite the dead star into life.
 [Bridge]
 KIRK: we just might get you to Babel after all,
Commodore. 
APRIL: I'll be glad to get home, but not necessarily to Babel. It only
means the end of my career, Jim. 
UHURA: Message coming in from Arret, Captain. 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: I want to wish you luck, Captain. Whether you
succeed or fail, the outcome will remain unknown to me. 
KIRK: Yes, Karla Five. We'll burn to a crisp or escape into our own
universe. Either way, you'll never hear from us again. Thank you for
the sacrifice of your vessel. 
KARLA [on viewscreen]: It is a small sacrifice, Captain Kirk. Success. 
SULU: Tractor beam working properly, Captain. 
AREX: We're meeting the speed of Karla Five's unmanned vessel, Captain.

KIRK: How much time before the youngest crew member returns to the time
of birth? 
SPOCK: Eighteen minutes thirty seven seconds in real time. But long
before that we shall all be children. And, Captain, that also means we
are losing our knowledge at an alarming rate. It is possible we will
soon be unable to operate the Enterprise. 
KIRK: How is our course, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: I don't know. What am I doing here? What is all this equipment? 
SPOCK: He's too young, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Arex, take over for him. Lieutenant Uhura, report to
navigation console. 
UHURA: I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand all this equipment. What do I
do with these controls? 
KIRK: Never mind. Spock, can you fill in for Sulu and Uhura? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain, but who will fill in for you? 
KIRK: What do you mean? 
SPOCK: At what age did you become a starship captain? And when did you
enter Starfleet Academy? 
KIRK: I see what you mean. 
SPOCK: As a Vulcan, I age the slowest. I will be capable of assuming
command longer than anyone else. But even I will become too young to
know what to do.
 Captain's log, supplemental. We have eleven
minutes of real time left to reach the dead star, but all around my
crew are turning into children, unable to operate the ship.
 [Bridge]
 (Kirk looks like he's not old enough to shave,
April is middle-aged and Uhura's feet don't reach the floor any more) 
SPOCK: Ten minutes fourteen point twenty one seconds, Captain. We shall
arrive with only moments to spare. We will need to disconnect the
tractor beam at the appropriate time. 
KIRK: Tractor beam? How do we do that, Spock? 
SPOCK: Captain, I must assume command. You are no longer able to
command the Enterprise.
KIRK: Whatever you say. What shall I do? 
APRIL: Mister Spock, as long as I am aboard, I am senior officer. I
hate to pull rank, but you will be capable of command only for a few
minutes, not long enough to complete the manoeuvres necessary to take
us home. 
SPOCK: You are correct, of course. Commodore April, command is yours. 
APRIL: Commodore? I'm Captain April, Mister Spock. 
SARAH: (now a vibrant red head) Robert, we're the only adults on the
bridge. They're all teenagers and children. 
APRIL: Make sure no harm comes to them, Sarah. We have to ignite that
dead star if we're going home. Mister Spock, you are still capable of
following orders? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
APRIL: Very good. Assume your post at the navigation console. 
SPOCK: The dead star is directly ahead, Captain, twelve degrees south
of galactic plane. 
APRIL: Arm Karla Five's vessel, Spock. 
SPOCK: Vessel armed, Captain. Nine seconds to impact. Eight, seven, 
(The two ships rush towards the star) 
SPOCK: Three, two 
APRIL: Hang on, we're going right into the heart of the nova. 
(Kaboom, sparkles, and Enterprise flies out of an expanding gas cloud,
the right way around) 
APRIL: We did it! We're home again! We're all right. We're home. The
reverse aging process has stopped. 
SARAH: But the Enterprise crew, they're all children. 
APRIL: They can enter the transporter. It retains a memory of their
original molecular structure. 
SARAH: But what about us? We don't have to use the transporter. We can
remain young, live our lives over again. You could command a starship
once more. 
APRIL: What a blessing to be able to live one's life over again, if the
life you've led has left you unfulfilled. No Sarah, I don't want to
live it all over again. I couldn't improve one bit on what we've had
together. 
SARAH: Oh, Robert. 
(They embrace and kiss) 
(Later, everyone is back to how they were at the start of the show) 
KIRK: We've received a message from the Federation that might bring you
some cheer. Lieutenant Uhura, would you relay it to Commodore April and
his wife? 
UHURA: In view of Commodore April's heroic actions aboard the USS
Enterprise this stardate, we are reviewing his mandatory retirement,
and will consider his appeal to remain Federation Ambassador at large. 
APRIL: Well, good. Just because someone is seventy five years old
doesn't mean they're ready to stop giving service to the galaxy! 
SULU: Arriving at Babel in one hour fifteen minutes, Captain. 
KIRK: I see your flower has blossomed again. 
SARAH: Yes, our trip into the negative universe gave it a second life.
It gave all of us a second life.
