(The Doctor walks in)

BASHIR: Well done. Now where is it we're going?

GARAK: I'll have the replicator back within the hour.

(Garak hands over a device from the replicator.)

BASHIR: What is it?

GARAK: A small golden chalice.

BASHIR: I thought you said it was a Promenade prize.

GARAK: It's a gift.

BASHIR: How did you know?

GARAK: It's a gift.

BASHIR: Lazare broke into my datapoints, and I had to track down his source.

GARAK: It's a gift.

BASHIR: So, where are we going?

GARAK: I don't know, but the time allows.

BASHIR: You mean, we're going to Romulus?

GARAK: Yes, but not alone. The information here is on the records of

Grunts VI. Anyone can find it. A little girl from the Jadzia cluster.

BASHIR: I don't understand.

GARAK: Yes, but it's a gift, and I'm sure you know it because

you've accepted it.

BASHIR: It's a pain in the butt?

GARAK: Oh, other than the fact that I was very pleased with this

dinner. I hope you had a wonderful time.

(Gare also hugs Bashir. He kisses her hand)

GARAK: Ah, well done.

(Dax enters with the Chalice)

GARAK: Long live Cardassia! Say hi.

(Dax leaves. Doctor Chang joins Garak)

GARAK: Hello. Happy eating, doctor.

(Next morning, Bashir goes to a formal dinner)

GARAK: Hello.

BASHIR: Oh, you're hungry?

GARAK: I feel hungry.

BASHIR: Perish the thought. Thank you.

GARAK: Perish the thought. Not if you don't take care of your

[Ops]

SISKO: Ben, if you covered Archon material in your

journal, please, I want to hear it.

GARAK: The fundamental problem with Gul Dukat is that he is incapable of

taking responsibility for his actions -- for his crimes against Cardassia.

SISKO: I have every confidence in you, Doctor.

GARAK: You're right. Gul Dal had his chance and rejected it. He has

it out, second, and he will not let anyone close to him put it in his

back.

SISKO: But General Martok is right. We cannot allow this man to be the next Defender of

Cardassia to take advantage of our people.

GARAK: But Roden's just the man for the job. He's shown himself

beyond reproach. I demand that he be reinstated as the new Supreme Commander.

SISKO: I don't want to rule over two million people!

GARAK: Then why are you at the bomb?

SISKO: Well, I've had enough of the cynicism. We have a responsibility

to defend Cardassia. You are here to take the position of the Founders.

GARAK: I don't care if my punishment is put to one side or another. The

judge said, as an effective counterinitiative, you have committed criminal

justice. You have given away your country and served it up to your victims

for the benefit of your friends and allies. I will not stand by while you

infest the very thing that brought you to Cardassia, when you are ready to launch

a full scale invasion of Cardassia.

(Garak turns to look past the stardate, then turns and goes back to the

door. He bites his finger. He holds it for the last few seconds as the

doorbell rings.)

GARAK: Come in.

SISKO: Sorry to see you.

GARAK: Come in.

(Garak nods to the PW brought in by the lady.)

SISKO: Is someone fussy?

GARAK: No.

SISKO: No.

(The young man is up, and there's a huge fire on a helicopter, then the

police arrive.)

QUARK: You're the police?

POLICE: That's right. I was just on the door to your quarters at twenty

four hundred hours, two minutes before the explosion.

QUARK: Your grandfather built this thing?

POLICE: It's a rocket thruster, meant to launch people into the

upper atmosphere. We used it in the Battle of Yvi'tara, stopping

the Mardah fleet in the process.

QUARK: Oh, I heard that. I used to go to their ships all the time.

POLICE: Exactly the same. We were the ships that fought my grandfather's

first invasion.

QUARK: You made a trip to the end of the galaxy to get ready for the

battle.

POLICE: Well, you must have gone a long time before that.

QUARK: Now where are we?

POLICE: To the southern hemisphere.

QUARK: A secret space station on the far side of the star formation, huh?

It's in no way visible from Earth.

POLICE: No, it is. We've been sent here by an astronomer.

QUARK: You wanted to see me? You could have seen me for weeks.

POLICE: We've just passed through the wormhole and are headed down

the path of least resistance.

QUARK: But what about the wormhole, your home?

POLICE: Now we have to face it.

QUARK: You look a lot better now, don't you, Detective?

POLICE: Maybe, but it's difficult to find all the markings of a

space station on a planet in the middle of a bubble.

QUARK: I really should call you something else.

POLICE: You should be writing your affidavit. My father was a space

navigator. He spent years at a secret space station in the

middle of the prime sector. It was called Fort Brigantine. When we arrived, the

wool was heated in the upper porth, and it became very foggy.

In the evening it became a spectacle. I don't SWITCH 

GARAK: And I said, well, that's a dozen different words.

QUARK: The Social Grammar of Dabo Dabo Dabo. Now, you see?

GARAK: What else seems to interest me?

QUARK: You can't argue with such a self-important buffoon.

QUARK: But he's still the one with time on his side. So, you see? You're

the one who's delaying gratification.

QUARK: Time to start getting my family some presents.

GARAK: It's not a present, it's a psorcery. You saw that

coming.

(Dax walks in.)

DAX: I was just having a hard time with my friend,

Simon. Which is why I came to you.

GARAK: Right. Right. That little game you call love.

DAX: What happened?

GARAK: I found out he was the one who murdered that young

girl.

DAX: Really? Well, I thought I said you were maybe taking her

in a little too seriously.

GARAK: I meant it as a slight.

DAX: And still you should be mad at Simon?

GARAK: I don't always play by his rules.

DAX: Or do you just call them rules?

GARAK: Laws?

DAX: No, right.

GARAK: This time I was just playing. Rivergrams don't have three

different endings. So this is supposed to be a Bittersweet

game?

(The waitress turns.)

QUARK: What are you doing here?

DAX: My friend Garak demanded a drink.

GARAK: What do you think you're doing?

QUARK: Freeing him.

QUARK: You're making a fool of yourself.

(The waitress puts Quark a drink in his hand.)

QUARK: The Dabo girls know it's a stupid game.

DAX: I'm just having a nice conversation.

QUARK: Why didn't I get a nervous breakdown?

(Dax leaves.)

QUARK: SWITCH

(Dax is just about finished with Odo)

WORF: You have to be watching your hands.

BASHIR: I am not going to let my security look down on me.

WORF: It is all right, Odo. You have no need to be afraid.

ODO: So that's it?

WORF: No, it is not all right.

ODO: What's this?

WORF: The ration of lifeblood which keeps you alive.

ODO: Can you tell me where it is?

WORF: It is at the very center of your being. It is a key

of law, of custom, of ritual.

ODO: Oh. I've seen a lot better. So, are you ready?

WORF: No, I am not.

ODO: Then who are you waiting for?

WORF: I have waited for the vital sign of your Lord

for even as long as I can remember.

DAX: You said he had the last of his blood.

WORF: I found it in the next room. He is clutching it in his

groin.

ODO: And it's highly inflammable.

WORF: He must have destroyed it as soon as he stepped out of the

room. It explodes when touched.

KIRA: I'm sure you know that. But if you forget your place in the

game, even the Lord of Kethatu won't be able to save you.

ODO: There has to be something you can do.

WORF: I will do everything I can to help. The Lord has given

me the key to the Rakata System.

ODO: Who is the Lord of Kethatu?

WORF: Is this the Rakata House of Nashrom?

DAX: This is a member of the House of Nashrom.

WORF: The House of Nashrom.

KIRA: This is a member of the House of Nashrom.

DAX: This is a member of the House of Nashrom.

ODO: The House of Nashrom.

WORF: They are now preparing to send SWITCH 

: The wormhole manipulator is Offline. The transponder is offline.

QUARK: I knew it! A Jem'Hadar ship has come through that system and

mathematically there's no way out.

 [Runabout Rio Grande]

(Quark is switching an auxiliary light bulb

on the runabout off when the sensor lock is triggered.)

QUARK: Crack! (an automated message on the screen) Emergency power

beginning to leak from the engines.

LOG-BASHIR: And what effect?

QUARK: We're reading a large electrical field continuously

orchestrating through the entire area. Mister Montgomery, get us into a Luke

Cosmonian plasma field.

(The message disappears.)

(Monty enters with Jem'Hadar commanders.)

QUARK: I don't understand.

LOG-BASHIR: All right. The ion trail will clear up tomorrow.

Monty: Main systems are offline.

QUARK: I hope we're saving all of this quarters-wastin'.

(Monty leaves.)

QUARK: I'm going to top off the electrolyte before we head home.

(Quark goes to the controls and slits off the control.)

DAX: A subspace field has formed around the ship.

QUARK: Incredibly powerful. Now what can we do?

DAX: This information generator will absorb all subspace radiation

and transmit it back to the alien system through a plasma field.

QUARK: Sounds good to me.

DAX: And how long will this be in place?

QUARK: Probably not very long.

(A silvery-haired woman enters.)

BASHIR: I have confused impulse with a lethal plasma wave.

QUARK: Suspect one.

DAX: A short time?

QUARK: Long. Over a century.

DAX: What happened?

QUARK: Nothing. Just the usual fallout, the ion trail and the

little girl.

DAX: I feel so familiar with this place.

QUARK: I don't think it's what I believe it is. Now why'd you bring the

female on SWITCH 

FALOW: He seems a decent enough chap to spend time with.

SISKO: We've got to get down to Ops.

(BOOM! Zoe enters)

QUARK: We've got to get down to Ops.

SISKO: We can't postpone this.

(BOOM! Slithery android and Zoe go into her case.)

QUARK: We've got to get down to Ops.

(BOOM! Zoe and Slithery android come out of the suit. Zoe pushes

the two on the ground. The weapon shatters Sisko's knee.)

 [Wardroom]

(Zoe is on the floor, Sisko is pistol-packing

his bag.)

BASHIR: I've got to get in here.

QUARK: You have more important things to do than to sit

here and do nothing.

JAKE: So are you going to say something to me?

QUARK: They're going to have to stay away from the girl.

JAKE: Jake's right. It's the rules. That's all that counts.

(BOOM! Zoe runs off.)

BASHIR: Zoe. I'm going to go talk to her.

 [Wardroom]

(Zoe is in the middle of a thorium

energy spiral.)

BASHIR: Yeah, she does have a certain charm to her.

BASHIR: Sir, if you'd taken a small course in warp core physics

before joining Starfleet, you would have taken advantage of every

battleground available to you.

DAX: Hmmm?

BASHIR: Yes, that's right. Warp core mechanics should be an

open door to entry into the enemy system.

DAX: Oh, it's just a few universes ago.

BASHIR: By allowing you access to the enemy system, you've

open'd it wide.

DAX: We're in the enemy system. I'm in the Science Lab.

BASHIR: We're entering the shuttleyard.

DAX: I'm going to tell you something. I'm not in love.

BASHIR: No, you're not! I don SWITCH р

BENNY: Who cares about Millionaires and Biscuits, whitey?

JAKE: (trying to look white) Cardassians are always on the run.

CH'POK: (within a Bajoran ring of lights) Three million and they were there at

twenty four hundred.

JAKE: It's hard to see how we all live over there in such

deluxe digs. You would think by now people would have figured this out.

CH'POK: That's absolutely right.

CH'POK: Dedicated Jem'Hadar.

JAKE: That's Ben.

CH'POK: Come in.

JAKE: Come in.

(O'Brien is at the salon area)

O'BRIEN: I was just being polite.

(O'Brien takes his coat off)

O'BRIEN: It's time.

(He enters)

BAYONNA: You can't be serious, Spock.

(O'Brien laughs)

BAYONNA: I've never heard of the O'Brien.

O'BRIEN: Stop threatening me. It's funny.

SISKO: The Jem'Hadar were still attacking the Defiant.

WEYOUN: The Jem'Hadar have re-aligned their magnetic fields in the last

fourteen hours.

JEM'HADAR: It's almost time.

(Sisko leaves)

JEM'HADAR: Then it's time.

JILAN'TAL'TALAN: The Defiant will be in orbit of Thoth to dock.

O'BRIEN: The last thing we want is the Jem'Hadar setting off a

false alarm.

WEYOUN: Doing away with the Defiant.

(The Jem'Hadar leave)

O'BRIEN: What about our crew?

WEYOUN: We've already appointed new leadership for the

Defiant. Starfleet SWITCH  As the Doctor talks, the other Wanderers leave in new vessels.)

(The last ship hauls Dax away, and we see the shape-shifter.)

DAX: Look, I know it's hard to believe, but that's no way to talk to a Ferengi.

SISKO: Doctor, if you don't explain, nothing will.

DAX: I'll try.

(Dax leaves in a ship with guns.)

SISKO: Then we're in real trouble.

DAX: I know you're afraid of us.

KIRA: Wouldn't you rather be fighting?

SISKO: No, we're trying to help. The message tells us you hate us.

(In the background, it says DEATH STAR.)

DAX: What's that?

JAKE: Radioactive waste is everywhere.

DAX: The last time we saw the Doctor, he was in a lab, cloned, switched on. He looked

like he had just gotten a date.

He was doing the rounds. And for a story about a beautiful humanoid, it's hard to

believe this man could be that good.

JAKE: Looks like we're going to lose him.

(Dax helps Odo launch the station into orbit

of Helios eight. A Jem'Hadar ship beams in.)

JEM'HADAR: This vessel has come here to request docking.

(The Jem'Hadar shoot the comm. wires. Dax helps Odo with the

battery.)

QUARK: All right, Doctor, do it!

(After the opening credits, the Jem'Hadar places the power cell in a pocket of

liquid nitrogen that they bring along to the outside.)

JEM'HADAR: Please, stand your ground.

DAX: The Jem'Hadar can't do that! You've them.

(Dax says to Odo to override alarms.)

JEM'HADAR: Suit yourself.

DAX: We'll wait outside.

with their SWITCH .

WORF: On your mark. Wait for confirmation!

(Dax and Worf steps over the coffin.)

WORF: Your mark clears, Major.

(Glamour snaps and Dax is swept down the aisle.)

WORF: Betrayal of form.

(Dax goes up against a cabinet and the box on the table.)

WORF: You are not to be trusted!

(Dax asks for the PADD.)

WORF: What do you have here?

DAX: The purest command statement I've ever heard.

WORF: The memory of your Vantika attack was your weakness!

DAX: You will never have the skill to destroy our program!

WORF: I cannot give you what you have not given yourself.

DAX: I have had enough. The time to kill you has passed.

WORF: The time has come, Major.

DAX: But there is a way back!

WORF: I know a way!

(The box opens, and the door closes.)

O'BRIEN: Wait.

(Dax enters)

DAX: Is this really necessary?

O'BRIEN: No. The story is told. All you have to do is activate the trap and

then place the audio-recordings on the console. You've to set it up

quickly.

DAX: Really?

O'BRIEN: It's going to take some getting used to, but I think you'll

like it.

DAX: Are you sure?

O'BRIEN: I think you will.

DAX: Thanks.

DAX: Come in.

KIRA: Dax!

DAX: Nerys.

KIRA: What?

DAX: Well, you were always so afraid to come in here.

KIRA: I've been stuck in this place for five years. How long has it been?

DAX: I haven't been out.

KIRA: Time flies when
